                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

[![Run npm tests](https://github.com/cloudflare/kv-asset-handler/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cloudflare/kv-asset-handler/actions/workflows/test.yml) &nbsp;
[![Lint Markdown](https://github.com/cloudflare/kv-asset-handler/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cloudflare/kv-asset-handler/actions/workflows/lint.yml) &nbsp;

`kv-asset-handler` is an open-source library for managing the retrieval of static assets from [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv) inside of a [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.dev) function. `kv-asset-handler` is designed for use with [Workers Sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/sites), a feature included in [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler), our command-line tool for deploying Workers projects.

`kv-asset-handler` runs as part of a Cloudflare Workers function, so it allows you to customize _how_ and _when_ your static assets are loaded, as well as customize how those assets behave before they're sent to the client.

Most users and sites will not need these customizations, and just want to serve their statically built applications. For that simple use-case, you can check out [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), our batteries-included approach to deploying static sites on Cloudflare's edge network. Workers Sites was designed as a precursor to Cloudflare Pages, so check out Pages if you just want to deploy your static site without any special customizations!

For users who _do_ want to customize their assets, and want to build complex experiences on top of their static assets, `kv-asset-handler` (and the default [Workers Sites template](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-sites-template), which is provided for use with Wrangler + Workers Sites) allows you to customize caching behavior, headers, and anything else about how your Workers function loads the static assets for your site stored in Workers KV.

The Cloudflare Workers Discord server is an active place where Workers users get help, share feedback, and collaborate on making our platform better. The `#workers` channel in particular is a great place to chat about `kv-asset-handler`, and building cool experiences for your users using these tools! If you have questions, want to share what you're working on, or give feedback, [join us in Discord and say hello](https://discord.gg/cloudflaredev)!

## Installation

Add this package to your `package.json` by running this in the root of your
project's directory:

```
npm i @cloudflare/kv-asset-handler
```

## Usage

This package was designed to work with [Worker Sites](https://workers.cloudflare.com/sites).

## `getAssetFromKV`

getAssetFromKV(Evt) => Promise<Response>

`getAssetFromKV` is an async function that takes an `Evt` object (containing a `Request` and a [`waitUntil`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event#waituntil)) and returns a `Response` object if the request matches an asset in KV, otherwise it will throw a `KVError`.

#### Example

This example checks for the existence of a value in KV, and returns it if it's there, and returns a 404 if it is not. It also serves index.html from `/`.

### Return

`getAssetFromKV` returns a `Promise<Response>` with `Response` being the body of the asset requested.

Known errors to be thrown are:

- MethodNotAllowedError
- NotFoundError
- InternalError

#### ES Modules

```js
import { getAssetFromKV, NotFoundError, MethodNotAllowedError } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'
import manifestJSON from '__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST'
const assetManifest = JSON.parse(manifestJSON)

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		if (request.url.includes('/docs')) {
			try {
				return await getAssetFromKV(
					{
						request,
						waitUntil(promise) {
							return ctx.waitUntil(promise)
						},
					},
					{
						ASSET_NAMESPACE: env.__STATIC_CONTENT,
						ASSET_MANIFEST: assetManifest,
					},
				)
			} catch (e) {
				if (e instanceof NotFoundError) {
					// ...
				} else if (e instanceof MethodNotAllowedError) {
					// ...
				} else {
					return new Response('An unexpected error occurred', { status: 500 })
				}
			}
		} else return fetch(request)
	},
}
```

#### Service Worker

```js
import { getAssetFromKV, NotFoundError, MethodNotAllowedError } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'

addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
	event.respondWith(handleEvent(event))
})

async function handleEvent(event) {
	if (event.request.url.includes('/docs')) {
		try {
			return await getAssetFromKV(event)
		} catch (e) {
			if (e instanceof NotFoundError) {
				// ...
			} else if (e instanceof MethodNotAllowedError) {
				// ...
			} else {
				return new Response('An unexpected error occurred', { status: 500 })
			}
		}
	} else return fetch(event.request)
}
```

### Optional Arguments

You can customize the behavior of `getAssetFromKV` by passing the following properties as an object into the second argument.

```
getAssetFromKV(event, { mapRequestToAsset: ... })
```

#### `mapRequestToAsset`

mapRequestToAsset(Request) => Request

Maps the incoming request to the value that will be looked up in Cloudflare's KV

By default, mapRequestToAsset is set to the exported function [`mapRequestToAsset`](#maprequesttoasset-1). This works for most static site generators, but you can customize this behavior by passing your own function as `mapRequestToAsset`. The function should take a `Request` object as its only argument, and return a new `Request` object with an updated path to be looked up in the asset manifest/KV.

For SPA mapping pass in the [`serveSinglePageApp`](#servesinglepageapp) function

#### Example

Strip `/docs` from any incoming request before looking up an asset in Cloudflare's KV.

```js
import { getAssetFromKV, mapRequestToAsset } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'
...
const customKeyModifier = request => {
  let url = request.url
  //custom key mapping optional
  url = url.replace('/docs', '').replace(/^\/+/, '')
  return mapRequestToAsset(new Request(url, request))
}
let asset = await getAssetFromKV(event, { mapRequestToAsset: customKeyModifier })
```

#### `cacheControl`

type: object

`cacheControl` allows you to configure options for both the Cloudflare Cache accessed by your Worker, and the browser cache headers sent along with your Workers' responses. The default values are as follows:

```javascript
let cacheControl = {
	browserTTL: null, // do not set cache control ttl on responses
	edgeTTL: 2 * 60 * 60 * 24, // 2 days
	bypassCache: false, // do not bypass Cloudflare's cache
}
```

##### `browserTTL`

type: number | null
nullable: true

Sets the `Cache-Control: max-age` header on the response returned from the Worker. By default set to `null` which will not add the header at all.

##### `edgeTTL`

type: number | null
nullable: true

Sets the `Cache-Control: max-age` header on the response used as the edge cache key. By default set to 2 days (`2 * 60 * 60 * 24`). When null will not cache on the edge at all.

##### `bypassCache`

type: boolean

Determines whether to cache requests on Cloudflare's edge cache. By default set to `false` (recommended for production builds). Useful for development when you need to eliminate the cache's effect on testing.

#### `ASSET_NAMESPACE` (required for ES Modules)

type: KV Namespace Binding

The binding name to the KV Namespace populated with key/value entries of files for the Worker to serve. By default, Workers Sites uses a [binding to a Workers KV Namespace](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/storage/api/#namespaces) named `__STATIC_CONTENT`.

It is further assumed that this namespace consists of static assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or image files, keyed off of a relative path that roughly matches the assumed URL pathname of the incoming request.

In ES Modules format, this argument is required, and can be gotten from `env`.

##### ES Module

```js
return getAssetFromKV(
	{
		request,
		waitUntil(promise) {
			return ctx.waitUntil(promise)
		},
	},
	{
		ASSET_NAMESPACE: env.__STATIC_CONTENT,
	},
)
```

##### Service Worker

```
return getAssetFromKV(event, { ASSET_NAMESPACE: MY_NAMESPACE })
```

#### `ASSET_MANIFEST` (required for ES Modules)

type: text blob (JSON formatted) or object

The mapping of requested file path to the key stored on Cloudflare.

Workers Sites with Wrangler bundles up a text blob that maps request paths to content-hashed keys that are generated by Wrangler as a cache-busting measure. If this option/binding is not present, the function will fallback to using the raw pathname to look up your asset in KV. If, for whatever reason, you have rolled your own implementation of this, you can include your own by passing a stringified JSON object where the keys are expected paths, and the values are the expected keys in your KV namespace.

In ES Modules format, this argument is required, and can be imported.

##### ES Module

```js
import manifestJSON from '__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST'
let manifest = JSON.parse(manifestJSON)
manifest['index.html'] = 'index.special.html'

return getAssetFromKV(
	{
		request,
		waitUntil(promise) {
			return ctx.waitUntil(promise)
		},
	},
	{
		ASSET_MANIFEST: manifest,
		// ...
	},
)
```

##### Service Worker

```
let assetManifest = { "index.html": "index.special.html" }
return getAssetFromKV(event, { ASSET_MANIFEST: assetManifest })
```

#### `defaultMimeType` (optional)

type: string

This is the mime type that will be used for files with unrecognized or missing extensions. The default value is `'text/plain'`.

If you are serving a static site and would like to use extensionless HTML files instead of index.html files, set this to `'text/html'`.

#### `defaultDocument` (optional)

type: string

This is the default document that will be concatenated for requests ends in `'/'` or without a valid mime type like `'/about'` or `'/about.me'`. The default value is `'index.html'`.

#### `defaultETag` (optional)

type: `'strong' | 'weak'`

This determines the format of the response [ETag header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag). If the resource is in the cache, the ETag will always be weakened before being returned.
The default value is `'strong'`.

# Helper functions

## `mapRequestToAsset`

mapRequestToAsset(Request) => Request

The default function for mapping incoming requests to keys in Cloudflare's KV.

Takes any path that ends in `/` or evaluates to an HTML file and appends `index.html` or `/index.html` for lookup in your Workers KV namespace.

## `serveSinglePageApp`

serveSinglePageApp(Request) => Request

A custom handler for mapping requests to a single root: `index.html`. The most common use case is single-page applications - frameworks with in-app routing - such as React Router, VueJS, etc. It takes zero arguments.

```js
import { getAssetFromKV, serveSinglePageApp } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'
...
let asset = await getAssetFromKV(event, { mapRequestToAsset: serveSinglePageApp })
```

# Cache revalidation and etags

All responses served from cache (including those with `cf-cache-status: MISS`) include an `etag` response header that identifies the version of the resource. The `etag` value is identical to the path key used in the `ASSET_MANIFEST`. It is updated each time an asset changes and looks like this: `etag: <filename>.<hash of file contents>.<extension>` (ex. `etag: index.54321.html`).

Resources served with an `etag` allow browsers to use the `if-none-match` request header to make conditional requests for that resource in the future. This has two major benefits:

- When a request's `if-none-match` value matches the `etag` of the resource in Cloudflare cache, Cloudflare will send a `304 Not Modified` response without a body, saving bandwidth.
- Changes to a file on the server are immediately reflected in the browser - even when the cache control directive `max-age` is unexpired.

#### Disable the `etag`

To turn `etags` **off**, you must bypass cache:

```js
/* Turn etags off */
let cacheControl = {
	bypassCache: true,
}
```

#### Syntax and comparison context

`kv-asset-handler` sets and evaluates etags as [strong validators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests#Strong_validation). To preserve `etag` integrity, the format of the value deviates from the [RFC2616 recommendation to enclose the `etag` with quotation marks](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.11). This is intentional. Cloudflare cache applies the `W/` prefix to all `etags` that use quoted-strings -- a process that converts the `etag` to a "weak validator" when served to a client.

      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

@npmcli/agent 2.2.0
ISC
## @npmcli/agent

A pair of Agent implementations for nodejs that provide consistent keep-alives, granular timeouts, dns caching, and proxy support.

### Usage

```js
const { getAgent, HttpAgent } = require('@npmcli/agent')
const fetch = require('minipass-fetch')

const main = async () => {
    // if you know what agent you need, you can create one directly
    const agent = new HttpAgent(agentOptions)
    // or you can use the getAgent helper, it will determine and create an Agent
    // instance for you as well as reuse that agent for new requests as appropriate
    const agent = getAgent('https://registry.npmjs.org/npm', agentOptions)
    // minipass-fetch is just an example, this will work for any http client that
    // supports node's Agents
    const res = await fetch('https://registry.npmjs.org/npm', { agent })
}

main()
```

### Options

All options supported by the node Agent implementations are supported here, see [the docs](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#new-agentoptions) for those.

Options that have been added by this module include:

- `family`: what tcp family to use, can be `4` for IPv4, `6` for IPv6 or `0` for both.
- `proxy`: a URL to a supported proxy, currently supports `HTTP CONNECT` based http/https proxies as well as socks4 and 5.
- `dns`: configuration for the built-in dns cache
    - `ttl`: how long (in milliseconds) to keep cached dns entries, defaults to `5 * 60 * 100 (5 minutes)`
    - `lookup`: optional function to override how dns lookups are performed, defaults to `require('dns').lookup`
- `timeouts`: a set of granular timeouts, all default to `0`
    - `connection`: time between initiating connection and actually connecting
    - `idle`: time between data packets (if a top level `timeout` is provided, it will be copied here)
    - `response`: time between sending a request and receiving a response
    - `transfer`: time between starting to receive a request and consuming the response fully

@parcel/watcher-wasm 2.3.0
MIT
# @parcel/watcher

A native C++ Node module for querying and subscribing to filesystem events. Used by [Parcel 2](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel).

## Features

- **Watch** - subscribe to realtime recursive directory change notifications when files or directories are created, updated, or deleted.
- **Query** - performantly query for historical change events in a directory, even when your program is not running.
- **Native** - implemented in C++ for performance and low-level integration with the operating system.
- **Cross platform** - includes backends for macOS, Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, and Watchman.
- **Performant** - events are throttled in C++ so the JavaScript thread is not overwhelmed during large filesystem changes (e.g. `git checkout` or `npm install`).
- **Scalable** - tens of thousands of files can be watched or queried at once with good performance.

## Example

```javascript
const watcher = require('@parcel/watcher');
const path = require('path');

// Subscribe to events
let subscription = await watcher.subscribe(process.cwd(), (err, events) => {
  console.log(events);
});

// later on...
await subscription.unsubscribe();

// Get events since some saved snapshot in the past
let snapshotPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'snapshot.txt');
let events = await watcher.getEventsSince(process.cwd(), snapshotPath);

// Save a snapshot for later
await watcher.writeSnapshot(process.cwd(), snapshotPath);
```

## Watching

`@parcel/watcher` supports subscribing to realtime notifications of changes in a directory. It works recursively, so changes in sub-directories will also be emitted.

Events are throttled and coalesced for performance during large changes like `git checkout` or `npm install`, and a single notification will be emitted with all of the events at the end.

Only one notification will be emitted per file. For example, if a file was both created and updated since the last event, you'll get only a `create` event. If a file is both created and deleted, you will not be notifed of that file. Renames cause two events: a `delete` for the old name, and a `create` for the new name.

```javascript
let subscription = await watcher.subscribe(process.cwd(), (err, events) => {
  console.log(events);
});
```

Events have two properties:

- `type` - the event type: `create`, `update`, or `delete`.
- `path` - the absolute path to the file or directory.

To unsubscribe from change notifications, call the `unsubscribe` method on the returned subscription object.

```javascript
await subscription.unsubscribe();
```

`@parcel/watcher` has the following watcher backends, listed in priority order:

- [FSEvents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/file_system_events) on macOS
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) if installed
- [inotify](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html) on Linux
- [ReadDirectoryChangesW](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365465%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) on Windows
- [kqueue](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?kqueue) on FreeBSD, or as an alternative to FSEvents on macOS

You can specify the exact backend you wish to use by passing the `backend` option. If that backend is not available on the current platform, the default backend will be used instead. See below for the list of backend names that can be passed to the options.

## Querying

`@parcel/watcher` also supports querying for historical changes made in a directory, even when your program is not running. This makes it easy to invalidate a cache and re-build only the files that have changed, for example. It can be **significantly** faster than traversing the entire filesystem to determine what files changed, depending on the platform.

In order to query for historical changes, you first need a previous snapshot to compare to. This can be saved to a file with the `writeSnapshot` function, e.g. just before your program exits.

```javascript
await watcher.writeSnapshot(dirPath, snapshotPath);
```

When your program starts up, you can query for changes that have occurred since that snapshot using the `getEventsSince` function.

```javascript
let events = await watcher.getEventsSince(dirPath, snapshotPath);
```

The events returned are exactly the same as the events that would be passed to the `subscribe` callback (see above).

`@parcel/watcher` has the following watcher backends, listed in priority order:

- [FSEvents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/file_system_events) on macOS
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) if installed
- [fts](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fts.3.html) (brute force) on Linux and FreeBSD
- [FindFirstFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findfirstfilea) (brute force) on Windows

The FSEvents (macOS) and Watchman backends are significantly more performant than the brute force backends used by default on Linux and Windows, for example returning results in miliseconds instead of seconds for large directory trees. This is because a background daemon monitoring filesystem changes on those platforms allows us to query cached data rather than traversing the filesystem manually (brute force).

macOS has good performance with FSEvents by default. For the best performance on other platforms, install [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) and it will be used by `@parcel/watcher` automatically.

You can specify the exact backend you wish to use by passing the `backend` option. If that backend is not available on the current platform, the default backend will be used instead. See below for the list of backend names that can be passed to the options.

## Options

All of the APIs in `@parcel/watcher` support the following options, which are passed as an object as the last function argument.

- `ignore` - an array of paths or glob patterns to ignore. uses [`is-glob`](https://github.com/micromatch/is-glob) to distinguish paths from globs. glob patterns are parsed with [`micromatch`](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) (see [features](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features)).
  - paths can be relative or absolute and can either be files or directories. No events will be emitted about these files or directories or their children.
  - glob patterns match on relative paths from the root that is watched. No events will be emitted for matching paths.
- `backend` - the name of an explicitly chosen backend to use. Allowed options are `"fs-events"`, `"watchman"`, `"inotify"`, `"kqueue"`, `"windows"`, or `"brute-force"` (only for querying). If the specified backend is not available on the current platform, the default backend will be used instead.

## WASM

The `@parcel/watcher-wasm` package can be used in place of `@parcel/watcher` on unsupported platforms. It relies on the Node `fs` module, so in non-Node environments such as browsers, an `fs` polyfill will be needed. The `@parcel/watcher-wasm` package is published as an ESM-only module.

**Note**: the WASM implementation is significantly less efficient than the native implementations because it must crawl the file system to watch each directory individually. Use the native `@parcel/watcher` package wherever possible.

```js
import {subscribe} from '@parcel/watcher-wasm';

// Use the module as documented above.
subscribe(/* ... */);
```

## Who is using this?

- [Parcel 2](https://parceljs.org/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_62#_file-watching-changes)
- [Tailwind CSS Intellisense](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense)

@polka/url 1.0.0-next.24
MIT
# @polka/url [![npm](https://badgen.now.sh/npm/v/@polka/url)](https://npmjs.org/package/@polka/url)

> Super fast, memoized `req.url` parser; _not_ limited to [Polka][polka]!

Parses the `url` from a [`IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) request. The returned object will always only contain the following keys: `search`, `query`, `pathname`, and `raw`.

> **Note:** This library does not process `protocol`, `hostname`, `port`, etc.<br>This is because the incoming `req.url` value only begins with the path information.

Parsed requests will be mutated with a `_parsedUrl` key, containing the returned output. This is used for future memoization, avoiding the need to fully parse the same `url` value multiple times.

## Install

```
$ npm install --save @polka/url
```

## Usage

```js
const parse = require('@polka/url');

let req = {
  url: '/foo/bar?fizz=buzz'
};
let output = parse(req);
//=> {
//=>   pathname: '/foo/bar',
//=>   raw: '/foo/bar?fizz=buzz',
//=>   search: '?fizz=buzz',
//=>   query: {
//=>     fizz: 'buzz'
//=>   },
//=> }

// Attaches result for future memoization
assert.deepEqual(output, req._parsedUrl); //=> true
```

## API

### url(req)
Returns: `Object` or `undefined`

> **Important:** The `req` must have a `url` key, otherwise `undefined` will be returned.<br>If no input is provided at all, a `TypeError` will be thrown.

#### req
Type: `IncomingMessage` or `{ url: string }`

The incoming HTTP request (`req`) or a plain `Object` with a `url` key.

> **Note:** In Node.js servers, the [`req.url`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_message_url) begins with a pathname & does not include a `hash`.


## Benchmarks

Check out the [`bench`](/bench) directory for in-depth benchmark results and comparisons.


## Support

Any issues or questions can be sent to the [Polka][polka] repository.<br>However, please specify that your inquiry is about `@polka/url` specifically.

# @rollup/plugin-inject

🍣 A Rollup plugin which scans modules for global variables and injects `import` statements where necessary.

## Requirements

This plugin requires an [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node version (v14.0.0+) and Rollup v1.20.0+.

## Install

Using npm:

```console
npm install @rollup/plugin-inject --save-dev
```

## Usage

Create a `rollup.config.js` [configuration file](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#configuration-files) and import the plugin:

```js
import inject from '@rollup/plugin-inject';

export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: {
    dir: 'output',
    format: 'cjs'
  },
  plugins: [
    inject({
      Promise: ['es6-promise', 'Promise']
    })
  ]
};
```

Then call `rollup` either via the [CLI](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#command-line-reference) or the [API](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#javascript-api).

This configuration above will scan all your files for global Promise usage and plugin will add import to desired module (`import { Promise } from 'es6-promise'` in this case).

Examples:

```js
{
  // import { Promise } from 'es6-promise'
  Promise: [ 'es6-promise', 'Promise' ],

  // import { Promise as P } from 'es6-promise'
  P: [ 'es6-promise', 'Promise' ],

  // import $ from 'jquery'
  $: 'jquery',

  // import * as fs from 'fs'
  fs: [ 'fs', '*' ],

  // use a local module instead of a third-party one
  'Object.assign': path.resolve( 'src/helpers/object-assign.js' ),
}
```

Typically, `@rollup/plugin-inject` should be placed in `plugins` _before_ other plugins so that they may apply optimizations, such as dead code removal.

## Options

In addition to the properties and values specified for injecting, users may also specify the options below.

### `exclude`

Type: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>
Default: `null`

A [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should _ignore_. By default no files are ignored.

### `include`

Type: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>
Default: `null`

A [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should operate on. By default all files are targeted.

# @rollup/plugin-wasm

🍣 A Rollup which allows importing and bundling [WebAssembly modules](http://webassembly.org).

WebAssembly Modules are imported asynchronous as base64 strings. Small modules [can be imported synchronously](#synchronous-modules).

## Requirements

This plugin requires an [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node version (v14.0.0+) and Rollup v1.20.0+.

## Install

Using npm:

```console
npm install @rollup/plugin-wasm --save-dev
```

## Usage

Create a `rollup.config.js` [configuration file](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#configuration-files) and import the plugin:

```js
import { wasm } from '@rollup/plugin-wasm';

export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: {
    dir: 'output',
    format: 'cjs'
  },
  plugins: [wasm()]
};
```

Then call `rollup` either via the [CLI](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#command-line-reference) or the [API](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#javascript-api).

## Options

### `exclude`

Type: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>
Default: `null`

A [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should _ignore_. By default no files are ignored.

### `include`

Type: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>
Default: `null`

A [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should operate on. By default all wasm files are targeted.

### `sync`

Type: `Array[...String]`<br>
Default: `null`

Specifies an array of strings that each represent a WebAssembly file to load synchronously. See [Synchronous Modules](#synchronous-modules) for a functional example.

### `maxFileSize`

Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `14336` (14kb)

The maximum file size for inline files. If a file exceeds this limit, it will be copied to the destination folder and loaded from a separate file at runtime. If `maxFileSize` is set to `0` all files will be copied.

Files specified in `sync` to load synchronously are always inlined, regardless of size.

### `fileName`

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `'[hash][extname]'`

This option can be used to rename the emitted Wasm files. It accepts the following string replacements:

- `[hash]` - The hash value of the file's contents
- `[name]` - The name of the imported file (without its file extension)
- `[extname]` - The extension of the imported file (including the leading `.`)

### `publicPath`

Type: `String`<br>
Default: (empty string)

A string which will be added in front of filenames when they are not inlined but are copied.

### `targetEnv`

Type: `"auto" | "browser" | "node"`<br>
Default: `"auto"`

Configures what code is emitted to instantiate the Wasm (both inline and separate):

- `"auto"` will determine the environment at runtime and invoke the correct methods accordingly
- `"auto-inline"` always inlines the Wasm and will decode it according to the environment
- `"browser"` omits emitting code that requires node.js builtin modules that may play havoc on downstream bundlers
- `"node"` omits emitting code that requires `fetch`

## Usage

This plugin looks for `import` statements where the file specifier ends with `.wasm`, such as:

```js
import wasm from './example.wasm';
```

The WebAssembly is inlined as a base64 encoded string. At runtime the string is decoded and a module is returned.

_Note: The base64 string that represents the WebAssembly within the bundle will be ~33% larger than the original file._

When bundled, `wasm` is a function you can use to instantiate the functionality inside of the WebAssembly module. This function returns a promise, so you can instantiate the module like this:

```js
import wasm from './example.wasm';

wasm().then(({ instance }) => {
  // use instance
});

// or use top-level await
const { instance } = await wasm();
```

The promise returns an object with an `instance` property that is a [`WebAssembly.Module`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript_interface/Module) object that you can use to interact with the WebAssembly module.

For example, given the following simple C file:

```c
int main() {
  return 42;
}
```

Compile the file using `emscripten`, or the online [WasmFiddle](https://wasdk.github.io/WasmFiddle/) tool. Then import and instantiate the resulting file:

```js
import sample from './sample.wasm';

sample().then(({ instance }) => {
  console.log(instance.exports.main());
});
```

### Passing Imports and Memory

If you'd like to pass any imports or memory into your WebAssembly module, you can do so by passing those as arguments to the WebAssembly loader function, like this:

```js
import sample from './sample.wasm';

const memory = new WebAssembly.Memory({ initial: 10, maximum: 100 });

const options = {
  js: {
    mem: memory
  },
  imports: {
    log: (arg) => console.log(arg)
  }
};

sample(options).then(({ instance }) => {
  console.log(instance.exports.main());
});
```

Because this example passes in `imports`, the `instance` becomes an instance of [`WebAssembly.Instance`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript_interface/Instance) and gives the WebAssembly code access to the imports and memory from JavaScript.

\_\_Note: Just passing in memory will result in a `WebAssembly.Module` as `instance`; it's only `imports` that triggers the creation of `WebAssembly.Instance`.

### Using with wasm-bindgen and wasm-pack

If you are writing Rust code and using [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) or [`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack), you'll need to use a different process for instantiating your WebAssembly modules. Because WebAssembly files generated by these tools require specific imports, you cannot provide these yourself.

The best setting to use with `wasm-bindgen` or `wasm-pack` is `--target web`. This will generate your WebAssembly files (such as `sample_bg.wasm`) with a JavaScript wrapper (such as `sample.js`). The JavaScript wrapper contains all of the instantiation code you'll need.

You'll need to import both the JavaScript file and the WebAssembly file into your project. Then, run the WebAssembly loading function and pass that into the `init()` function from the JavaScript file. Here's an example:

```js
import init, { main } from '../build/sample.js';
import sample from '../build/sample_bg.wasm';

sample()
  .then({ instance } => init(instance))
  .then(() => main());

// or using top-level await

await init(await sample());
main();
```

Unlike with the `emscripten` example, you'll need to import the methods you want to use directly from the JavaScript file rather than accessing them on the `WebAssembly.Instance`.

### Synchronous Modules

JavaScript runtimes allow small modules (< 4KB) to be compiled synchronously. If you'd like to specify some files to be compiled synchronously, you can do so in your `rollup.config.js` file.

```js
import { wasm } from '@rollup/plugin-wasm';

export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: {
    dir: 'output',
    format: 'cjs'
  },
  plugins: [
    wasm({
      sync: ['web/sample.wasm', 'web/foobar.wasm']
    });
  ]
};
```

Synchronous modules return a synchronous loader function that returns either a `WebAssembly.Module` or `WebAssembly.Instance` directly (not a promise). So you can use the module directly, like this:

```js
import sample from './sample.wasm';

const instance = sample({ ...imports });

console.log(instance.exports.main());
```

# @rollup/pluginutils

A set of utility functions commonly used by 🍣 Rollup plugins.

## Requirements

This plugin requires an [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node version (v8.0.0+) and Rollup v1.20.0+.

## Install

Using npm:

```console
npm install @rollup/pluginutils --save-dev
```

## Usage

```js
import utils from '@rollup/pluginutils';
//...
```

## API

Available utility functions are listed below:

_Note: Parameter names immediately followed by a `?` indicate that the parameter is optional._

### addExtension

Adds an extension to a module ID if one does not exist.

Parameters: `(filename: String, ext?: String)`<br>
Returns: `String`

```js
import { addExtension } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  return {
    resolveId(code, id) {
      // only adds an extension if there isn't one already
      id = addExtension(id); // `foo` -> `foo.js`, `foo.js` -> `foo.js`
      id = addExtension(id, '.myext'); // `foo` -> `foo.myext`, `foo.js` -> `foo.js`
    }
  };
}
```

### attachScopes

Attaches `Scope` objects to the relevant nodes of an AST. Each `Scope` object has a `scope.contains(name)` method that returns `true` if a given name is defined in the current scope or a parent scope.

Parameters: `(ast: Node, propertyName?: String)`<br>
Returns: `Object`

See [rollup-plugin-inject](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-inject) or [rollup-plugin-commonjs](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs) for an example of usage.

```js
import { attachScopes } from '@rollup/pluginutils';
import { walk } from 'estree-walker';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  return {
    transform(code) {
      const ast = this.parse(code);

      let scope = attachScopes(ast, 'scope');

      walk(ast, {
        enter(node) {
          if (node.scope) scope = node.scope;

          if (!scope.contains('foo')) {
            // `foo` is not defined, so if we encounter it,
            // we assume it's a global
          }
        },
        leave(node) {
          if (node.scope) scope = scope.parent;
        }
      });
    }
  };
}
```

### createFilter

Constructs a filter function which can be used to determine whether or not certain modules should be operated upon.

Parameters: `(include?: <picomatch>, exclude?: <picomatch>, options?: Object)`<br>
Returns: `String`

#### `include` and `exclude`

Type: `String | RegExp | Array[...String|RegExp]`<br>

A valid [`picomatch`](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#globbing-features) pattern, or array of patterns. If `options.include` is omitted or has zero length, filter will return `true` by default. Otherwise, an ID must match one or more of the `picomatch` patterns, and must not match any of the `options.exclude` patterns.

Note that `picomatch` patterns are very similar to [`minimatch`](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#readme) patterns, and in most use cases, they are interchangeable. If you have more specific pattern matching needs, you can view [this comparison table](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#library-comparisons) to learn more about where the libraries differ.

#### `options`

##### `resolve`

Type: `String | Boolean | null`

Optionally resolves the patterns against a directory other than `process.cwd()`. If a `String` is specified, then the value will be used as the base directory. Relative paths will be resolved against `process.cwd()` first. If `false`, then the patterns will not be resolved against any directory. This can be useful if you want to create a filter for virtual module names.

#### Usage

```js
import { createFilter } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  // assume that the myPlugin accepts options of `options.include` and `options.exclude`
  var filter = createFilter(options.include, options.exclude, {
    resolve: '/my/base/dir'
  });

  return {
    transform(code, id) {
      if (!filter(id)) return;

      // proceed with the transformation...
    }
  };
}
```

### dataToEsm

Transforms objects into tree-shakable ES Module imports.

Parameters: `(data: Object)`<br>
Returns: `String`

#### `data`

Type: `Object`

An object to transform into an ES module.

#### Usage

```js
import { dataToEsm } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

const esModuleSource = dataToEsm(
  {
    custom: 'data',
    to: ['treeshake']
  },
  {
    compact: false,
    indent: '\t',
    preferConst: false,
    objectShorthand: false,
    namedExports: true
  }
);
/*
Outputs the string ES module source:
  export const custom = 'data';
  export const to = ['treeshake'];
  export default { custom, to };
*/
```

### extractAssignedNames

Extracts the names of all assignment targets based upon specified patterns.

Parameters: `(param: Node)`<br>
Returns: `Array[...String]`

#### `param`

Type: `Node`

An `acorn` AST Node.

#### Usage

```js
import { extractAssignedNames } from '@rollup/pluginutils';
import { walk } from 'estree-walker';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  return {
    transform(code) {
      const ast = this.parse(code);

      walk(ast, {
        enter(node) {
          if (node.type === 'VariableDeclarator') {
            const declaredNames = extractAssignedNames(node.id);
            // do something with the declared names
            // e.g. for `const {x, y: z} = ...` => declaredNames = ['x', 'z']
          }
        }
      });
    }
  };
}
```

### makeLegalIdentifier

Constructs a bundle-safe identifier from a `String`.

Parameters: `(str: String)`<br>
Returns: `String`

#### Usage

```js
import { makeLegalIdentifier } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

makeLegalIdentifier('foo-bar'); // 'foo_bar'
makeLegalIdentifier('typeof'); // '_typeof'
```

### normalizePath

Converts path separators to forward slash.

Parameters: `(filename: String)`<br>
Returns: `String`

#### Usage

```js
import { normalizePath } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

normalizePath('foo\\bar'); // 'foo/bar'
normalizePath('foo/bar'); // 'foo/bar'
```

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

# @webassemblyjs/wasm-edit

> Rewrite a WASM binary

Replace in-place an AST node in the binary.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @webassemblyjs/wasm-edit
```

## Usage

Update:

```js
import { edit } from "@webassemblyjs/wasm-edit";

const binary = [/*...*/];

const visitors = {
  ModuleImport({ node }) {
    node.module = "foo";
    node.name = "bar";
  }
};

const newBinary = edit(binary, visitors);
```

Replace:

```js
import { edit } from "@webassemblyjs/wasm-edit";

const binary = [/*...*/];

const visitors = {
  Instr(path) {
    const newNode = t.callInstruction(t.indexLiteral(0));
    path.replaceWith(newNode);
  }
};

const newBinary = edit(binary, visitors);
```

Remove:

```js
import { edit } from "@webassemblyjs/wasm-edit";

const binary = [/*...*/];

const visitors = {
  ModuleExport({ node }) {
    path.remove()
  }
};

const newBinary = edit(binary, visitors);
```

Insert:

```js
import { add } from "@webassemblyjs/wasm-edit";

const binary = [/*...*/];

const newBinary = add(actualBinary, [
  t.moduleImport("env", "mem", t.memory(t.limit(1)))
]);
```

## Providing the AST

Providing an AST allows you to handle the decoding yourself, here is the API:

```js
addWithAST(Program, ArrayBuffer, Array<Node>): ArrayBuffer;
editWithAST(Program, ArrayBuffer, visitors): ArrayBuffer;
```

Note that the AST will be updated in-place.

### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```


Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');

var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etc…
});
```

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

agent-base 7.1.0
MIT
agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance

This module is a thin wrapper around the base `http.Agent` class.

It provides an abstract class that must define a `connect()` function,
which is responsible for creating the underlying socket that the HTTP
client requests will use.

The `connect()` function may return an arbitrary `Duplex` stream, or
another `http.Agent` instance to delegate the request to, and may be
asynchronous (by defining an `async` function).

Instances of this agent can be used with the `http` and `https`
modules. To differentiate, the options parameter in the `connect()`
function includes a `secureEndpoint` property, which can be checked
to determine what type of socket should be returned.

 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS

Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` or `tls.Socket`
based on the `secureEndpoint` property. This agent can be used with both
the `http` and `https` modules.

```ts
import * as net from 'net';
import * as tls from 'tls';
import * as http from 'http';
import { Agent } from 'agent-base';

class MyAgent extends Agent {
  connect(req, opts) {
    // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the "https" module
    if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
      return tls.connect(opts);
    } else {
      return net.connect(opts);
    }
  }
});

// Keep alive enabled means that `connect()` will only be
// invoked when a new connection needs to be created
const agent = new MyAgent({ keepAlive: true });

// Pass the `agent` option when creating the HTTP request
http.get('http://nodejs.org/api/', { agent }, (res) => {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

argparse 2.0.1
Python-2.0
A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, CNRI
hereby grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide
license to reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly,
prepare derivative works, distribute, and otherwise use Python 1.6.1
alone or in any derivative version, provided, however, that CNRI's
License Agreement and CNRI's notice of copyright, i.e., "Copyright (c)
1995-2001 Corporation for National Research Initiatives; All Rights
Reserved" are retained in Python 1.6.1 alone or in any derivative
version prepared by Licensee.  Alternately, in lieu of CNRI's License
Agreement, Licensee may substitute the following text (omitting the
quotes): "Python 1.6.1 is made available subject to the terms and
conditions in CNRI's License Agreement.  This Agreement together with
Python 1.6.1 may be located on the Internet using the following
unique, persistent identifier (known as a handle): 1895.22/1013.  This
Agreement may also be obtained from a proxy server on the Internet
using the following URL: http://hdl.handle.net/1895.22/1013".

3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on
or incorporates Python 1.6.1 or any part thereof, and wants to make
the derivative work available to others as provided herein, then
Licensee hereby agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of
the changes made to Python 1.6.1.

4. CNRI is making Python 1.6.1 available to Licensee on an "AS IS"
basis.  CNRI MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED.  BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION, CNRI MAKES NO AND
DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF PYTHON 1.6.1 WILL NOT
INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

5. CNRI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON
1.6.1 FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS
A RESULT OF MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON 1.6.1,
OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material
breach of its terms and conditions.

7. This License Agreement shall be governed by the federal
intellectual property law of the United States, including without
limitation the federal copyright law, and, to the extent such
U.S. federal law does not apply, by the law of the Commonwealth of
Virginia, excluding Virginia's conflict of law provisions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with regard to derivative works based
on Python 1.6.1 that incorporate non-separable material that was
previously distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the
law of the Commonwealth of Virginia shall govern this License
Agreement only as to issues arising under or with respect to
Paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of this License Agreement.  Nothing in this
License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship of
agency, partnership, or joint venture between CNRI and Licensee.  This
License Agreement does not grant permission to use CNRI trademarks or
trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote products or
services of Licensee, or any third party.

boolbase 1.0.0
ISC
#boolbase
This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).

###WTF?

By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.

###And why is this a separate module?

I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
     for the public:

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

clear 0.1.0

clear
=====

Clear the terminal screen if possible

Usage
-----

``` js
var clear = require('clear');
clear();
```

Example
-------

![Node Clear](http://daveeddy.com/static/media/github/node-clear.gif)

### clear([opts])

- `opts` (Object)
- `opts.fullClear` (Boolean) Defaults to `true`, setting this to `false` will
  prevent this module from clearing the screen.  This will not remove anything
  from the screen, but instead move your cursor to position 0,0.  Much like
  printing a `\r` instead of a `\n` to reset the current line of output.

Installation
------------

    npm install clear

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

<p align="center">

    <img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dagre-d3-es.svg?logo=npm&logoColor=fff&label=NPM+package&color=limegreen" alt="dagre-d3-es on npm" />

# dagre-d3-es

The [dagre-d3](https://github.com/dagrejs) library is not maintained anymore.

[dagre-d3-es](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dagre-d3-es) is a fork using the more modern ES6 javascript syntax.
It uses [ES](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/) modules, thus the name [dagre-d3-es](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dagre-d3-es).

[dagre-d3-es](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dagre-d3-es) follows [d3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3) versions. Ex: dagre-d3-es version 7 depends on [d3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3) version 7.

## Demos

[Simple graph demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/dagre-d3-es-tree-9ywg9) using react, dagre-d3-es, [d3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3) version 7.2.

## Install

```
npm install dagre-d3-es --save
```

## Code example

Coming from the legacy `dagre-d3`, the main changes in your code will be:

```
import * as dagreD3 from 'dagre-d3-es';
...
const g = new dagreD3.graphlib.Graph().setGraph({});
...
const zoom = d3.zoom().on('zoom', (zoomEvent) => {
  inner.attr('transform', zoomEvent.transform);
});

```

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

2. License Grants and Conditions

2.1. Grants

     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as
        part of a Larger Work; and

     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
        or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
     such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

      This Source Code Form is subject to the
      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
      2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not
      distributed with this file, You can
      obtain one at
      http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

      This Source Code Form is “Incompatible
      With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by
      the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

elkjs 0.8.2
EPL-2.0
# Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE (“AGREEMENT”). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

## 1. DEFINITIONS

“Contribution” means:

-   a\) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
    Distributed under this Agreement, and
-   b\) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
    -   i\) changes to the Program, and
    -   ii\) additions to the Program;

    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
    and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
    “originates” from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
    such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
    behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the
    Program that are not Modified Works.

“Contributor” means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

“Licensed Patents” mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
or when combined with the Program.

“Program” means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

“Recipient” means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

“Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

“Modified Works” shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
or Modified Works thereof.

“Distribute” means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in
any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

“Source Code” means the form of a Program preferred for making
modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
documentation source, and configuration files.

“Secondary License” means either the GNU General Public License, Version
2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or
additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.

## 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

-   a\) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
    license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
    publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
    Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
-   b\) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license
    under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
    otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in
    Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the
    combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
    Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
    Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
    Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
    combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
    licensed hereunder.
-   c\) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
    secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
    to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire
    that license before distributing the Program.
-   d\) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
    license set forth in this Agreement.
-   e\) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor
    makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in
    this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program
    under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of
    Section 3).

## 3. REQUIREMENTS

3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

-   a\) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance
    with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a
    statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this
    Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable
    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange;
    and
-   b\) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different
    than this Agreement, provided that such license:
    -   i\) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
    -   ii\) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental
        and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
    -   iii\) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the
        Source Code under section 3.2; and
    -   iv\) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to
        be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.

3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

-   a\) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i)
    is combined with other material in a separate file or files made
    available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor
    attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this
    Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of
    such Secondary Licenses, and
-   b\) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
    the Program.

3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
of liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of
the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
their own appropriate notices.

## 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in
a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial
Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and
costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other
legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified
Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
must pay those damages.

## 5. NO WARRANTY {#warranty}

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS”
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

## 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY {#disclaimer}

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

## 7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this
Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has
the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the
initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is
published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including
its Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

## Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice {#exhibit-a}

“This Source Code may also be made available under the following
Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth
in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.”

> Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is
> not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
>
> If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
> file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
> file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
> look for such a notice.
>
> You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Create new error instances with a code and additional properties.


## Installation

```console
$ npm install err-code
// or
$ bower install err-code
```

The browser file is named index.umd.js which supports CommonJS, AMD and globals (errCode).


## Why

I find myself doing this repeatedly:

```js
var err = new Error('My message');
err.code = 'SOMECODE';
err.detail = 'Additional information about the error';
throw err;
```


## Usage

Simple usage.

```js
var errcode = require('err-code');

// fill error with message + code
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), 'ESOMECODE');
// fill error with message + code + props
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), 'ESOMECODE', { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });
// fill error with message + props
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });
```

## Pre-existing fields

If the passed `Error` already has a `.code` field, or fields specified in the third argument to `errcode` they will be overwritten, unless the fields are read only or otherwise throw during assignment in which case a new object will be created that shares a prototype chain with the original `Error`. The `.stack` and `.message` properties will be carried over from the original error and `.code` or any passed properties will be set on it.


## Tests

`$ npm test`

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

esrecurse 4.3.0
BSD-2-Clause
### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)

Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is
[ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
recursive traversing functionality.

### Example Usage

The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(ast, {
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});
```

We can use `Visitor` instance.

```javascript
var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});

visitor.visit(ast);
```

We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.

```javascript
class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {
    constructor()
    {
        super(null);
    }

    XXXStatement(node) {
    }
}
```

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    this.visit(node.left);
    // do something...
    this.visit(node.right);
};
```

And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    // do something...
    this.visitChildren(node);
};
```

The `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`.
We can use user-defined node types.

```javascript
// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.
var tree = {
    type: 'TestExpression',

    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.
    argument: {
        type: 'Literal',
        value: 20
    },

    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.
    extended: true
};
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        // Extending the existing traversing rules.
        childVisitorKeys: {
            // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]
            TestExpression: ['argument']
        }
    }
);
```

We can use the `fallback` option as well.
If the `fallback` option is `"iteration"`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: 'iteration'
    }
);
```

If the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: function (node) {
            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {
                return key !== 'argument'
            });
        }
    }
);
```

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

    other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object
    form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice
    that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the
    Appendix below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,
    that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
    revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent,
    as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this
    License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable
    from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and
    Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
    version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or

    For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of

    owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
    behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

2. Grant of Copyright License.

    Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
    hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
    Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
    and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in
    Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License.

    Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
    hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
    license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
    otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
    patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
    infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
    Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
    If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
    Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
    contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
    You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
    litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution.

    You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
    thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or
    Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

    1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
    copy of this License; and

    2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that You changed the files; and

    3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain
    to any part of the Derivative Works; and

    4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
    then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy
    of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
    those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works,
    in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
    distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a
    display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such
    third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are
    for informational purposes only and do not modify the License.
    You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
    distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
    provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
    provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
    reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
    Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
    distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions
    stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.

    Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
    submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under
    the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional
    terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
    supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
    have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks.

    This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
    service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
    reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
    reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
    provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions)
    on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
    either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
    or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
    associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability.

    In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort
    (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
    applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed
    to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
    including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
    damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of
    the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
    for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
    or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
    Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

    While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
    to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
    indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
    this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
    other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold
    each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
    asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
    warranty or additional liability.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work

    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate
    notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced with your own
    identifying information. (Don't include the brackets!) The text should be
    enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also
    recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included
    on the same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
    identification within third-party archives.

BSD-2-Clause
# Glob To Regular Expression

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/glob-to-regexp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/glob-to-regexp)

Turn a \*-wildcard style glob (`"*.min.js"`) into a regular expression
(`/^.*\.min\.js$/`)!

To match bash-like globs, eg. `?` for any single-character match, `[a-z]` for
character ranges, and `{*.html, *.js}` for multiple alternatives, call with
`{ extended: true }`.

To obey [globstars `**`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) rules set option `{globstar: true}`.
NOTE: This changes the behavior of `*` when `globstar` is `true` as shown below:
When `{globstar: true}`: `/foo/**` will match any string that starts with `/foo/`
like `/foo/index.htm`, `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, etc.  Also, `/foo/**/*.txt` will match
any string that starts with `/foo/` and ends with `.txt` like `/foo/bar.txt`,
`/foo/bar/baz.txt`, etc.
Whereas `/foo/*` (single `*`, not a globstar) will match strings that start with
`/foo/` like `/foo/index.htm`, `/foo/baz.txt` but will not match strings that
contain a `/` to the right like `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, `/foo/bar/baz/qux.dat`, etc.

Set flags on the resulting `RegExp` object by adding the `flags` property to the option object, eg `{ flags: "i" }` for ignoring case.

## Install

    npm install glob-to-regexp

## Usage
```js
var globToRegExp = require('glob-to-regexp');
var re = globToRegExp("p*uck");
re.test("pot luck"); // true
re.test("pluck"); // true
re.test("puck"); // true

re = globToRegExp("*.min.js");
re.test("http://example.com/jquery.min.js"); // true
re.test("http://example.com/jquery.min.js.map"); // false

re = globToRegExp("*/www/*.js");
re.test("http://example.com/www/app.js"); // true
re.test("http://example.com/www/lib/factory-proxy-model-observer.js"); // true

// Extended globs
re = globToRegExp("*/www/{*.js,*.html}", { extended: true });
re.test("http://example.com/www/app.js"); // true
re.test("http://example.com/www/index.html"); // true
```

## What is this?

This package is a utility to get the plain-text value of a node.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package when you want to get the plain text value of a node.
The algorithm used by this package is like the DOMs `Node#textContent`
getter.

To use the DOMs `Node#innerText` algorithm instead, use
[`hast-util-to-text`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast-util-to-text).
`innerText` is aware of how things are displayed, for example turning hard
breaks (`<br>`) into line endings.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install hast-util-to-string
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```js
import {toString} from 'https://esm.sh/hast-util-to-string@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {toString} from 'https://esm.sh/hast-util-to-string@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {h} from 'hastscript'
import {toString} from 'hast-util-to-string'

toString(h('p', 'Alpha'))
//=> 'Alpha'
toString(h('div', [h('b', 'Bold'), ' and ', h('i', 'italic'), '.']))
//=> 'Bold and italic.'
```

## API

This package exports the identifier
`toString`.
There is no default export.

### `toString(node)`

Get the plain-text value of a node.

###### Parameters

*   `node` (`Node`) — node to serialize

###### Returns

Serialized node (`string`).

## Syntax

HTML is parsed according to WHATWG HTML (the living standard), which is also
followed by all browsers.

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree used is [hast][].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`hast-util-to-string@^3`,
compatible with Node.js 16.

## Security

As **rehype** works on HTML and improper use of HTML can open you up to a
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of rehype can also be unsafe.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to make the tree safe.

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`rehypejs/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.
See [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.

This project has a [code of conduct][coc].

https-proxy-agent 5.0.1
MIT
https-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install https-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var options = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
options.agent = agent;

https.get(options, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var options = url.parse(proxy);

var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);

// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
"options" object with more specific properties:

  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

### new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy: string | URL, options?: HttpsProxyAgentOptions)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `proxy` argument is the URL for the proxy server.

The `options` argument accepts the usual `http.Agent` constructor options, and
some additional properties:

 * `headers` - Object containing additional headers to send to the proxy server
   in the `CONNECT` request.

      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

imurmurhash 0.1.4
MIT
iMurmurHash.js
==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
```

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```

Then simply include it in your scripts:

```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```

Quick Example
-------------

```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

# Is Module

Check whether a source string looks like an ES6 module.
This doesn't actually execute the code,
and doesn't check other module types.
So source strings without any module loaders returns `false`.

This is just what I need from https://github.com/yahoo/js-module-formats, which actually executes the sauce string in a subcontext.

## API

```js
var isES6Module = require('is-module');

console.log(isES6Module('import * from "emitter";')) // => true
```

is-reference 1.2.1

# is-reference

Utility for determining whether an AST node is a reference.

`foo` is a reference in these cases:

```js
console.log( foo );
var foo;
function foo () {}
function bar ( foo ) {}
export { foo as x };
```

`foo` is *not* a reference in these cases:

```js
var obj = { foo: 1 };
console.log( obj.foo );
export { x as foo };
```

In all cases, `foo` is an `Identifier` node, but the two kinds must be treated differently for the purposes of scope analysis etc. (The examples are non-exhaustive.)


## Installation

```bash
npm install is-reference
```


## Usage

Example using [Acorn](https://github.com/ternjs/acorn) and [estree-walker](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/estree-walker):

```js
const { parse } = require( 'acorn' );
const { walk } = require( 'estree-walker' );
const isReference = require( 'is-reference' );

const identifiers = [];
const references = [];

const ast = parse( `var a = b.c;` );

walk( ast, {
	enter ( node, parent ) {
		if ( node.type === 'Identifier' ) identifiers.push( node );
		if ( isReference( node, parent ) ) references.push( node );
	}
});

identifiers.forEach( node => console.log( node.name ) ); // a, b, c
references.forEach( node => console.log( node.name ) ); // a, b
```

> Simple key-value storage with support for multiple backends

[![build](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/actions/workflows/tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/actions/workflows/tests.yaml)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/jaredwray/keyv/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=bRzR3RyOXZ)](https://codecov.io/gh/jaredwray/keyv)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/keyv.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/keyv.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv)

Keyv provides a consistent interface for key-value storage across multiple backends via storage adapters. It supports TTL based expiry, making it suitable as a cache or a persistent key-value store.

## Features

There are a few existing modules similar to Keyv, however Keyv is different because it:

- Isn't bloated
- Has a simple Promise based API
- Suitable as a TTL based cache or persistent key-value store
- [Easily embeddable](#add-cache-support-to-your-module) inside another module
- Works with any storage that implements the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) API
- Handles all JSON types plus `Buffer`
- Supports namespaces
- Wide range of [**efficient, well tested**](#official-storage-adapters) storage adapters
- Connection errors are passed through (db failures won't kill your app)
- Supports the current active LTS version of Node.js or higher

## Usage

Install Keyv.

```
npm install --save keyv
```

By default everything is stored in memory, you can optionally also install a storage adapter.

```
npm install --save @keyv/redis
npm install --save @keyv/mongo
npm install --save @keyv/sqlite
npm install --save @keyv/postgres
npm install --save @keyv/mysql
npm install --save @keyv/etcd
```

Create a new Keyv instance, passing your connection string if applicable. Keyv will automatically load the correct storage adapter.

```js
const Keyv = require('keyv');

// One of the following
const keyv = new Keyv();
const keyv = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379');
const keyv = new Keyv('mongodb://user:pass@localhost:27017/dbname');
const keyv = new Keyv('sqlite://path/to/database.sqlite');
const keyv = new Keyv('postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname');
const keyv = new Keyv('mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/dbname');
const keyv = new Keyv('etcd://localhost:2379');

// Handle DB connection errors
keyv.on('error', err => console.log('Connection Error', err));

await keyv.set('foo', 'expires in 1 second', 1000); // true
await keyv.set('foo', 'never expires'); // true
await keyv.get('foo'); // 'never expires'
await keyv.delete('foo'); // true
await keyv.clear(); // undefined
```

### Namespaces

You can namespace your Keyv instance to avoid key collisions and allow you to clear only a certain namespace while using the same database.

```js
const users = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'users' });
const cache = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'cache' });

await users.set('foo', 'users'); // true
await cache.set('foo', 'cache'); // true
await users.get('foo'); // 'users'
await cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'
await users.clear(); // undefined
await users.get('foo'); // undefined
await cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'
```

### Custom Serializers

Keyv uses [`json-buffer`](https://github.com/dominictarr/json-buffer) for data serialization to ensure consistency across different backends.

You can optionally provide your own serialization functions to support extra data types or to serialize to something other than JSON.

```js
const keyv = new Keyv({ serialize: JSON.stringify, deserialize: JSON.parse });
```

**Warning:** Using custom serializers means you lose any guarantee of data consistency. You should do extensive testing with your serialisation functions and chosen storage engine.

## Official Storage Adapters

The official storage adapters are covered by [over 150 integration tests](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/actions/workflows/tests.yaml) to guarantee consistent behaviour. They are lightweight, efficient wrappers over the DB clients making use of indexes and native TTLs where available.

Database | Adapter | Native TTL
---|---|---
Redis | [@keyv/redis](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/redis) | Yes
MongoDB | [@keyv/mongo](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mongo) | Yes 
SQLite | [@keyv/sqlite](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/sqlite) | No 
PostgreSQL | [@keyv/postgres](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/postgres) | No 
MySQL | [@keyv/mysql](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mysql) | No 
Etcd | [@keyv/etcd](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/etcd) | Yes
Memcache | [@keyv/memcache](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/memcache) | Yes

## Third-party Storage Adapters

You can also use third-party storage adapters or build your own. Keyv will wrap these storage adapters in TTL functionality and handle complex types internally.

```js
const Keyv = require('keyv');
const myAdapter = require('./my-storage-adapter');

const keyv = new Keyv({ store: myAdapter });
```

Any store that follows the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) api will work.

```js
new Keyv({ store: new Map() });
```

For example, [`quick-lru`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) is a completely unrelated module that implements the Map API.

```js
const Keyv = require('keyv');
const QuickLRU = require('quick-lru');

const lru = new QuickLRU({ maxSize: 1000 });
const keyv = new Keyv({ store: lru });
```

The following are third-party storage adapters compatible with Keyv:

- [quick-lru](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) - Simple "Least Recently Used" (LRU) cache
- [keyv-file](https://github.com/zaaack/keyv-file) - File system storage adapter for Keyv
- [keyv-dynamodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-dynamodb) - DynamoDB storage adapter for Keyv
- [keyv-lru](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-lru) - LRU storage adapter for Keyv
- [keyv-null](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-null) - Null storage adapter for Keyv
- [keyv-firestore ](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/keyv-firestore) – Firebase Cloud Firestore adapter for Keyv
- [keyv-mssql](https://github.com/pmorgan3/keyv-mssql) - Microsoft Sql Server adapter for Keyv
- [keyv-azuretable](https://github.com/howlowck/keyv-azuretable) - Azure Table Storage/API adapter for Keyv
- [keyv-arango](https://github.com/TimMikeladze/keyv-arango) - ArangoDB storage adapter for Keyv
- [keyv-momento](https://github.com/momentohq/node-keyv-adaptor/) - Momento storage adapter for Keyv

## Add Cache Support to your Module

Keyv is designed to be easily embedded into other modules to add cache support. The recommended pattern is to expose a `cache` option in your modules options which is passed through to Keyv. Caching will work in memory by default and users have the option to also install a Keyv storage adapter and pass in a connection string, or any other storage that implements the `Map` API.

You should also set a namespace for your module so you can safely call `.clear()` without clearing unrelated app data.

Inside your module:

```js
class AwesomeModule {
	constructor(opts) {
		this.cache = new Keyv({
			uri: typeof opts.cache === 'string' && opts.cache,
			store: typeof opts.cache !== 'string' && opts.cache,
			namespace: 'awesome-module'
		});
	}
}
```

Now it can be consumed like this:

```js
const AwesomeModule = require('awesome-module');

// Caches stuff in memory by default
const awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule();

// After npm install --save keyv-redis
const awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: 'redis://localhost' });

// Some third-party module that implements the Map API
const awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: some3rdPartyStore });
```

## Compression

Keyv supports `gzip` and `brotli` compression. To enable compression, pass the `compress` option to the constructor.

```js
const KeyvGzip = require('@keyv/compress-gzip');
const Keyv = require('keyv');

const keyvGzip = new KeyvGzip();
const keyv = new Keyv({ compression: KeyvGzip });
```

You can also pass a custom compression function to the `compression` option. Following the pattern of the official compression adapters.

### Want to build your own? 

Great! Keyv is designed to be easily extended. You can build your own compression adapter by following the pattern of the official compression adapters based on this interface:

```typescript
interface CompressionAdapter {
	async compress(value: any, options?: any);
	async decompress(value: any, options?: any);
	async serialize(value: any);
	async deserialize(value: any);
}
```

In addition to the interface, you can test it with our compression test suite using @keyv/test-suite:

```js
const {keyvCompresstionTests} = require('@keyv/test-suite');
const KeyvGzip = require('@keyv/compress-gzip');

keyvCompresstionTests(test, new KeyvGzip());
```

## API

### new Keyv([uri], [options])

Returns a new Keyv instance.

The Keyv instance is also an `EventEmitter` that will emit an `'error'` event if the storage adapter connection fails.

### uri

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `undefined`

The connection string URI.

Merged into the options object as options.uri.

### options

Type: `Object`

The options object is also passed through to the storage adapter. Check your storage adapter docs for any extra options.

#### options.namespace

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `'keyv'`

Namespace for the current instance.

#### options.ttl

Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Default TTL. Can be overridden by specififying a TTL on `.set()`.

#### options.compression

Type: `@keyv/compress-<compression_package_name>`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Compression package to use. See [Compression](#compression) for more details.

#### options.serialize

Type: `Function`<br>
Default: `JSONB.stringify`

A custom serialization function.

#### options.deserialize

Type: `Function`<br>
Default: `JSONB.parse`

A custom deserialization function.

#### options.store

Type: `Storage adapter instance`<br>
Default: `new Map()`

The storage adapter instance to be used by Keyv.

#### options.adapter

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Specify an adapter to use. e.g `'redis'` or `'mongodb'`.

### Instance

Keys must always be strings. Values can be of any type.

#### .set(key, value, [ttl])

Set a value.

By default keys are persistent. You can set an expiry TTL in milliseconds.

Returns a promise which resolves to `true`.

#### .get(key, [options])

Returns a promise which resolves to the retrieved value.

##### options.raw

Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

If set to true the raw DB object Keyv stores internally will be returned instead of just the value.

This contains the TTL timestamp.

#### .delete(key)

Deletes an entry.

Returns a promise which resolves to `true` if the key existed, `false` if not.

#### .clear()

Delete all entries in the current namespace.

Returns a promise which is resolved when the entries have been cleared.

#### .iterator()

Iterate over all entries of the current namespace.

Returns a iterable that can be iterated by for-of loops. For example:

```js
// please note that the "await" keyword should be used here
for await (const [key, value] of this.keyv.iterator()) {
  console.log(key, value);
};
```

# How to Contribute

In this section of the documentation we will cover:

1) How to set up this repository locally
2) How to get started with running commands
3) How to contribute changes using Pull Requests

## Dependencies

This package requires the following dependencies to run:

1) [Yarn V1](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
3) [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Setting up your workspace

To contribute to this repository, start by setting up this project locally:

1) Fork this repository into your Git account
2) Clone the forked repository to your local directory using `git clone`
3) Install any of the above missing dependencies

## Launching the project

Once the project is installed locally, you are ready to start up its services:

1) Ensure that your Docker service is running.
2) From the root directory of your project, run the `yarn` command in the command prompt to install yarn.
3) Run the `yarn bootstrap` command to  install any necessary dependencies.
4) Run `yarn test:services:start` to start up this project's Docker container. The container will launch all services within your workspace.

## Available Commands

Once the project is running, you can execute a variety of commands. The root workspace and each subpackage contain a `package.json` file with a  `scripts` field listing all the commands that can be executed from that directory. This project also supports native `yarn`, and `docker` commands.

Here, we'll cover the primary commands that can be executed from the root directory. Unless otherwise noted, these commands can also be executed from a subpackage. If executed from a subpackage, they will only affect that subpackage, rather than the entire workspace.

### `yarn`

The `yarn` command installs yarn in the workspace.

### `yarn bootstrap`

The `yarn bootstrap` command installs all dependencies in the workspace.

### `yarn test:services:start`

The `yarn test:services:start` command starts up the project's Docker container, launching all services in the workspace. This command must be executed from the root directory.

### `yarn test:services:stop`

The `yarn test:services:stop` command brings down the project's Docker container, halting all services. This command must be executed from the root directory.

### `yarn test`

The `yarn test` command runs all tests in the workspace.

### `yarn clean`

The `yarn clean` command removes yarn and all dependencies installed by yarn. After executing this command, you must repeat the steps in *Setting up your workspace* to rebuild your workspace.

## Contributing Changes

Now that you've set up your workspace, you're ready to contribute changes to the `keyv` repository.

1) Make any changes that you would like to contribute in your local workspace.
2) After making these changes, ensure that the project's tests still pass by executing the `yarn test` command in the root directory.
3) Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
4) Navigate to the original `keyv` repository and go the *Pull Requests* tab.
5) Click the *New pull request* button, and open a pull request for the branch in your repository that contains your changes.
6) Once your pull request is created, ensure that all checks have passed and that your branch has no conflicts with the base branch. If there are any issues, resolve these changes in your local repository, and then commit and push them to git.
7) Similarly, respond to any reviewer comments or requests for changes by making edits to your local repository and pushing them to Git.
8) Once the pull request has been reviewed, those with write access to the branch will be able to merge your changes into the `keyv` repository.

If you need more information on the steps to create a pull request, you can find a detailed walkthrough in the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
  and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
  depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
  a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
  or other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
  CC0 or use of the Work.

CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
  and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
  depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
  a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as

affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
  or other rights required for any use of the Work.

[micromark][] constructs that make up the core of CommonMark.
Some of these can be [turned off][disable], but they are often essential to
markdown and weird things might happen.

## What is this?

This package exposes the default constructs.

## When should I use this?

This package is useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-core-commonmark
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import * as core from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-core-commonmark@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import * as core from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-core-commonmark@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {autolink} from 'micromark-core-commonmark'

console.log(autolink) // Do things with `autolink`.
```

## API

This module exports the following identifiers: `attention`, `autolink`,
`blankLine`, `blockQuote`, `characterEscape`, `characterReference`,
`codeFenced`, `codeIndented`, `codeText`, `content`, `definition`,
`hardBreakEscape`, `headingAtx`, `htmlFlow`, `htmlText`, `labelEnd`,
`labelStartImage`, `labelStartLink`, `lineEnding`, `list`, `setextUnderline`,
`thematicBreak`.
There is no default export.

Each identifier refers to a [construct][].

See the code for more on the exported constructs.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`micromark-core-commonmark@^2`, compatible with Node.js 16.
This package works with `micromark@^3`.

## Security

This package is safe.
See [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to
submit a security report.

## What is this?

This package exposes states to parse spaces and/or tabs.

## When should I use this?

This package is useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-factory-space
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {factorySpace} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-factory-space@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {factorySpace} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-factory-space@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {factorySpace} from 'micromark-factory-space'
import {codes} from 'micromark-util-symbol/codes'
import {types} from 'micromark-util-symbol/types'

// A micromark tokenizer that uses the factory:
/**
 * @this {TokenizeContext}
 * @type {Tokenizer}
 */
function tokenizeCodeFenced(effects, ok, nok) {
  return start

  // …

  /** @type {State} */
  function info(code) {
    if (code === codes.eof || markdownLineEndingOrSpace(code)) {
      effects.exit(types.chunkString)
      effects.exit(types.codeFencedFenceInfo)
      return factorySpace(effects, infoAfter, types.whitespace)(code)
    }

    if (code === codes.graveAccent && code === marker) return nok(code)
    effects.consume(code)
    return info
  }

  // …
}
```

## API

This module exports the identifier [`factorySpace`][api-factory-space].
There is no default export.

### `factorySpace(…)`

Parse spaces and tabs.

There is no `nok` parameter:

*   spaces in markdown are often optional, in which case this factory can be
    used and `ok` will be switched to whether spaces were found or not
*   one line ending or space can be detected with `markdownSpace(code)` right
    before using `factorySpace`

###### Examples

Where `␉` represents a tab (plus how much it expands) and `␠` represents a
single space.

```markdown
␉
␠␠␠␠
␉␠
```

###### Parameters

*   `effects` (`Effects`)
    — context
*   `ok` (`State`)
    — state switched to when successful
*   `type` (`string`)
    — type (`' \t'`)
*   `max` (`number`, default: `Infinity`)
    — max (exclusive)

###### Returns

Start state (`State`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 16+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This package works with `micromark` version 3+.

## Security

This package is safe.
See [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to
submit a security report.

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.
See [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.

This project has a [code of conduct][coc].

## What is this?

This package exposes states to parse whitespace.

## When should I use this?

This package is useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-factory-whitespace
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {factoryWhitespace} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-factory-whitespace@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {factoryWhitespace} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-factory-whitespace@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {factoryWhitespace} from 'micromark-factory-whitespace'
import {codes} from 'micromark-util-symbol/codes'
import {types} from 'micromark-util-symbol/types'

// A micromark tokenizer that uses the factory:
/**
 * @this {TokenizeContext}
 * @type {Tokenizer}
 */
function tokenizeTitle(effects, ok, nok) {
  return start

  /** @type {State} */
  function start(code) {
    return markdownLineEndingOrSpace(code)
      ? factoryWhitespace(effects, before)(code)
      : nok(code)
  }

  // …
}
```

## API

This module exports the identifier
[`factoryWhitespace`][api-factory-whitespace].
There is no default export.

### `factoryWhitespace(…)`

Parse spaces and tabs.

There is no `nok` parameter:

*   line endings or spaces in markdown are often optional, in which case this
    factory can be used and `ok` will be switched to whether spaces were found
    or not
*   one line ending or space can be detected with
    [`markdownLineEndingOrSpace(code)`][ws] right before using
    `factoryWhitespace`

###### Parameters

*   `effects` (`Effects`)
    — context
*   `ok` (`State`)
    — state switched to when successful

###### Returns

Start state (`State`).

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`micromark-factory-whitespace@^2`, compatible with Node.js 16.
This package works with `micromark@^3`.

## Security

This package is safe.

An **ASCII alpha** is an ASCII upper alpha or ASCII lower alpha.

An **ASCII upper alpha** is a character in the inclusive range U+0041 (`A`)
to U+005A (`Z`).

An **ASCII lower alpha** is a character in the inclusive range U+0061 (`a`)
to U+007A (`z`).

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `asciiAlphanumeric(code)`

Check whether the [character code][code] represents an ASCII alphanumeric (`a`
through `z`, case insensitive, or `0` through `9`).

An **ASCII alphanumeric** is an ASCII digit (see `asciiDigit`) or ASCII alpha
(see `asciiAlpha`).

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `asciiAtext(code)`

Check whether the [character code][code] represents an ASCII atext.

atext is an ASCII alphanumeric (see `asciiAlphanumeric`), or a character in
the inclusive ranges U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (`#`) to U+0027 APOSTROPHE (`'`),
U+002A ASTERISK (`*`), U+002B PLUS SIGN (`+`), U+002D DASH (`-`), U+002F
SLASH (`/`), U+003D EQUALS TO (`=`), U+003F QUESTION MARK (`?`), U+005E
CARET (`^`) to U+0060 GRAVE ACCENT (`` ` ``), or U+007B LEFT CURLY BRACE
(`{`) to U+007E TILDE (`~`) (**\[RFC5322]**).

See **\[RFC5322]**:\
[Internet Message Format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322).\
P. Resnick.\
IETF.

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `asciiControl(code)`

Check whether a [character code][code] is an ASCII control character.

An **ASCII control** is a character in the inclusive range U+0000 NULL (NUL)
to U+001F (US), or U+007F (DEL).

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `asciiDigit(code)`

Check whether the [character code][code] represents an ASCII digit (`0` through
`9`).

An **ASCII digit** is a character in the inclusive range U+0030 (`0`) to
U+0039 (`9`).

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `asciiHexDigit(code)`

Check whether the [character code][code] represents an ASCII hex digit (`a`
through `f`, case insensitive, or `0` through `9`).

An **ASCII hex digit** is an ASCII digit (see `asciiDigit`), ASCII upper hex
digit, or an ASCII lower hex digit.

An **ASCII upper hex digit** is a character in the inclusive range U+0041
(`A`) to U+0046 (`F`).

An **ASCII lower hex digit** is a character in the inclusive range U+0061
(`a`) to U+0066 (`f`).

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `asciiPunctuation(code)`

Check whether the [character code][code] represents ASCII punctuation.

An **ASCII punctuation** is a character in the inclusive ranges U+0021
EXCLAMATION MARK (`!`) to U+002F SLASH (`/`), U+003A COLON (`:`) to U+0040 AT

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

Check whether a [character code][code] is a markdown line ending.

A **markdown line ending** is the virtual characters M-0003 CARRIAGE RETURN
LINE FEED (CRLF), M-0004 LINE FEED (LF) and M-0005 CARRIAGE RETURN (CR).

In micromark, the actual character U+000A LINE FEED (LF) and U+000D CARRIAGE
RETURN (CR) are replaced by these virtual characters depending on whether
they occurred together.

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `markdownLineEndingOrSpace(code)`

Check whether a [character code][code] is a markdown line ending (see
`markdownLineEnding`) or markdown space (see `markdownSpace`).

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)

A **markdown space** is the concrete character U+0020 SPACE (SP) and the
virtual characters M-0001 VIRTUAL SPACE (VS) and M-0002 HORIZONTAL TAB (HT).

In micromark, the actual character U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (HT) is
replaced by one M-0002 HORIZONTAL TAB (HT) and between 0 and 3 M-0001 VIRTUAL
SPACE (VS) characters, depending on the column at which the tab occurred.

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `unicodePunctuation(code)`

Check whether the [character code][code] represents Unicode punctuation.

A **Unicode punctuation** is a character in the Unicode `Pc` (Punctuation,
Connector), `Pd` (Punctuation, Dash), `Pe` (Punctuation, Close), `Pf`
(Punctuation, Final quote), `Pi` (Punctuation, Initial quote), `Po`
(Punctuation, Other), or `Ps` (Punctuation, Open) categories, or an ASCII
punctuation (see `asciiPunctuation`) (**\[UNICODE]**).

See **\[UNICODE]**:\
[The Unicode Standard](https://www.unicode.org/versions/).\
Unicode Consortium.

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `unicodeWhitespace(code)`

Check whether the [character code][code] represents Unicode whitespace.

Note that this does handle micromark specific markdown whitespace characters.
See `markdownLineEndingOrSpace` to check that.

A **Unicode whitespace** is a character in the Unicode `Zs` (Separator,
Space) category, or U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (HT), U+000A LINE FEED (LF),
U+000C (FF), or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) (**\[UNICODE]**).

See **\[UNICODE]**:\
[The Unicode Standard](https://www.unicode.org/versions/).\
Unicode Consortium.

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to splice for giant arrays, which V8 bugs
out on.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-chunked
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {push, splice} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-chunked@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {push, splice} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-chunked@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {push, splice} from 'micromark-util-chunked'

// …

nextEvents = push(nextEvents, [
  ['enter', events[open][1], context],
  ['exit', events[open][1], context]
])

// …

splice(events, open - 1, index - open + 3, nextEvents)

// …
```

## API

This module exports the identifiers [`push`][api-push]
and [`splice`][api-splice].
There is no default export.

### `push(list, items)`

Append `items` (an array) at the end of `list` (another array).
When `list` was empty, returns `items` instead.

This prevents a potentially expensive operation when `list` is empty,
and adds items in batches to prevent V8 from hanging.

###### Parameters

*   `list` (`Array<unknown>`)
    — list to operate on
*   `items` (`Array<unknown>`)
    — items to add to `list`

###### Returns

Either `list` or `items` (`Array<unknown>`).

### `splice(list, start, remove, items)`

Like `Array#splice`, but smarter for giant arrays.

`Array#splice` takes all items to be inserted as individual argument which
causes a stack overflow in V8 when trying to insert 100k items for instance.

Otherwise, this does not return the removed items, and takes `items` as an
array instead of rest parameters.

###### Parameters

*   `list` (`Array<unknown>`)
    — list to operate on
*   `start` (`number`)
    — index to remove/insert at (can be negative)
*   `remove` (`number`)
    — number of items to remove
*   `items` (`Array<unknown>`)
    — items to inject into `list`

###### Returns

Nothing (`void`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 16+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This package works with `micromark` version 3+.

## Security

This package is safe.
See [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to
submit a security report.

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.
See [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.

This project has a [code of conduct][coc].

  return start

  // …

  /** @type {State} */
  function sequence(code) {
    if (code === marker) {
      // …
    }

    const token = effects.exit('attentionSequence')
    const after = classifyCharacter(code)
    const open =
      !after || (after === constants.characterGroupPunctuation && before)
    const close =
      !before || (before === constants.characterGroupPunctuation && after)

  }

  // …
}
```

## API

This module exports the identifier
[`classifyCharacter`][api-classify-character].
There is no default export.

### `classifyCharacter(code)`

Classify whether a code represents whitespace, punctuation, or something
else.

Used for attention (emphasis, strong), whose sequences can open or close
based on the class of surrounding characters.

> 👉 **Note**: eof (`null`) is seen as whitespace.

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Group (`constants.characterGroupWhitespace`,
`constants.characterGroupPunctuation`, or `undefined`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to classify characters into 3 categories.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-classify-character
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {classifyCharacter} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-classify-character@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {classifyCharacter} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-classify-character@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
/**
 * @this {TokenizeContext}
 * @type {Tokenizer}
 */
function tokenizeAttention(effects, ok) {
  return start

  // …

  /** @type {State} */
  function sequence(code) {
    if (code === marker) {
      // …
    }

    const token = effects.exit('attentionSequence')
    const after = classifyCharacter(code)
    const open =
      !after || (after === constants.characterGroupPunctuation && before)
    const close =
      !before || (before === constants.characterGroupPunctuation && after)
    // …
  }

  // …
}
```

## API

This module exports the identifier
[`classifyCharacter`][api-classify-character].
There is no default export.

### `classifyCharacter(code)`

Classify whether a code represents whitespace, punctuation, or something
else.

Used for attention (emphasis, strong), whose sequences can open or close
based on the class of surrounding characters.

> 👉 **Note**: eof (`null`) is seen as whitespace.

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Group (`constants.characterGroupWhitespace`,
`constants.characterGroupPunctuation`, or `undefined`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`micromark-util-classify-character@^2`, compatible with Node.js 16.
This package works with `micromark@^3`.

## Security

This package is safe.
See [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to
submit a security report.

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.

## Use

```js
import {decodeNumericCharacterReference} from 'micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference'

decodeNumericCharacterReference('41', 16) // 'A'
decodeNumericCharacterReference('65', 10) // 'A'
decodeNumericCharacterReference('A', 16) // '\n'
decodeNumericCharacterReference('7F', 16) // '�' - Control
decodeNumericCharacterReference('110000', 16) // '�' - Out of range
```

## API

This module exports the identifier:
[`decodeNumericCharacterReference`][api-decode-numeric-character-reference].
There is no default export.

### `decodeNumericCharacterReference(value, base)`

Turn the number (in string form as either hexa- or plain decimal) coming from
a numeric character reference into a character.

Sort of like `String.fromCharCode(Number.parseInt(value, base))`, but makes
non-characters and control characters safe.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`)
    — value to decode
*   `base` (`number`, probably `10` or `16`)
    — numeric base

###### Returns

Character (`string`).

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to decode numeric character references.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {decodeNumericCharacterReference} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {decodeNumericCharacterReference} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {decodeNumericCharacterReference} from 'micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference'

decodeNumericCharacterReference('41', 16) // 'A'
decodeNumericCharacterReference('65', 10) // 'A'
decodeNumericCharacterReference('A', 16) // '\n'
decodeNumericCharacterReference('7F', 16) // '�' - Control
decodeNumericCharacterReference('110000', 16) // '�' - Out of range
```

## API

This module exports the identifier:
[`decodeNumericCharacterReference`][api-decode-numeric-character-reference].
There is no default export.

### `decodeNumericCharacterReference(value, base)`

Turn the number (in string form as either hexa- or plain decimal) coming from
a numeric character reference into a character.

Sort of like `String.fromCodePoint(Number.parseInt(value, base))`, but makes
non-characters and control characters safe.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`)
    — value to decode
*   `base` (`number`, probably `10` or `16`)
    — numeric base

###### Returns

Character (`string`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference@^2`, compatible with
Node.js 16.
This package works with `micromark@^3`.

## Security

This package is safe.
See [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to
submit a security report.

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.
See [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.

This project has a [code of conduct][coc].

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to make text safe for embedding in HTML.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-encode
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {encode} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-encode@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {encode} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-encode@1?bundle'

## Use

```js
import {encode} from 'micromark-util-encode'

encode('<3') // '&lt;3'
```

## API

This module exports the identifier [`encode`][api-encode].
There is no default export.

### `encode(value)`

Encode only the dangerous HTML characters.

This ensures that certain characters which have special meaning in HTML are
dealt with.
Technically, we can skip `>` and `"` in many cases, but CM includes them.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`)
    — value to encode

###### Returns

Encoded value (`string`).

import {htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-html-tag-name@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-html-tag-name@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames} from 'micromark-util-html-tag-name'

console.log(htmlBlockNames) // ['address', 'article', …]
console.log(htmlRawNames) // ['pre', 'script', …]
```

## API

This module exports the identifiers [`htmlBlockNames`][api-html-block-names]
and [`htmlRawNames`][api-html-raw-names].
There is no default export.

### `htmlBlockNames`

List of lowercase HTML “block” tag names (`Array<string>`).

The list, when parsing HTML (flow), results in more relaxed rules (condition
6\).
Because they are known blocks, the HTML-like syntax doesn’t have to be strictly
parsed.
For tag names not in this list, a more strict algorithm (condition 7) is used
to detect whether the HTML-like syntax is seen as HTML (flow) or not.

This is copied from:
<https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks>.

> 👉 **Note**: `search` was added in `CommonMark@0.31`.

### `htmlRawNames`

List of lowercase HTML “raw” tag names (`Array<string>`).

The list, when parsing HTML (flow), results in HTML that can include lines
without exiting, until a closing tag also in this list is found (condition
1\).

This module is copied from:
<https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks>.

> 👉 **Note**: `textarea` was added in `CommonMark@0.30`.

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to normalize identifiers found in markdown.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-normalize-identifier
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {normalizeIdentifier} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-normalize-identifier@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {normalizeIdentifier} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-normalize-identifier@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {normalizeIdentifier} from 'micromark-util-normalize-identifier'

normalizeIdentifier(' a ') // 'A'
normalizeIdentifier('a\t\r\nb') // 'A B'
normalizeIdentifier('ТОЛПОЙ') // 'ТОЛПОЙ'
normalizeIdentifier('Толпой') // 'ТОЛПОЙ'
```

## API

This module exports the identifier
[`normalizeIdentifier`][api-normalize-identifier].
There is no default export.

### `normalizeIdentifier(value)`

Normalize an identifier (as found in references, definitions).

Collapses markdown whitespace, trim, and then lower- and uppercase.

Some characters are considered “uppercase”, such as U+03F4 (`ϴ`), but if their
lowercase counterpart (U+03B8 (`θ`)) is uppercased will result in a different
uppercase character (U+0398 (`Θ`)).
So, to get a canonical form, we perform both lower- and uppercase.

Using uppercase last makes sure keys will never interact with default
prototypal values (such as `constructor`): nothing in the prototype of `Object`
is uppercase.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`)
    — identifier to normalize

###### Returns

Normalized identifier (`string`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 16+.

## Security

[micromark][] utility to resolve subtokens.

[Resolvers][resolver] are functions that take events and manipulate them.
This is needed for example because media (links, images) and attention (strong,
italic) aren’t parsed left-to-right.
Instead, their openings and closings are parsed, and when done, their openings
and closings are matched, and left overs are turned into plain text.
Because media and attention can’t overlap, we need to perform that operation
when one closing matches an opening, too.

  // Walk through all events.
  while (++index < events.length) {
    // Find a token that can close.
    if (
      events[index][0] === 'enter' &&
      events[index][1].type === 'attentionSequence' &&
      events[index][1]._close
    ) {
      open = index

      // Now walk back to find an opener.
      while (open--) {
        // Find a token that can open the closer.
        if (
          // …
        ) {
          // …

          // Opening.
          nextEvents = push(nextEvents, [
            // …
          ])

          // Between.
          nextEvents = push(
            nextEvents,
            resolveAll(
              context.parser.constructs.insideSpan.null,
              events.slice(open + 1, index),
              context

[micromark][] utility to resolve subtokens.

[Resolvers][resolver] are functions that take events and manipulate them.
This is needed for example because media (links, images) and attention (strong,
italic) aren’t parsed left-to-right.
Instead, their openings and closings are parsed, and when done, their openings
and closings are matched, and left overs are turned into plain text.
Because media and attention can’t overlap, we need to perform that operation
when one closing matches an opening, too.

## What is this?

This package exposes a micromark internal that you probably don’t need.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-resolve-all
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {resolveAll} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-resolve-all@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {resolveAll} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-resolve-all@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {push} from 'micromark-util-chunked'
import {resolveAll} from 'micromark-util-resolve-all'

/**
 * @type {Resolver}
 */
function resolveAllAttention(events, context) {
  // …

  // Walk through all events.
  while (++index < events.length) {
    // Find a token that can close.
    if (
      events[index][0] === 'enter' &&
      events[index][1].type === 'attentionSequence' &&
      events[index][1]._close
    ) {
      open = index

      // Now walk back to find an opener.
      while (open--) {
        // Find a token that can open the closer.
        if (
          // …
        ) {
          // …

          // Opening.
          nextEvents = push(nextEvents, [
            // …
          ])

          // Between.
          nextEvents = push(
            nextEvents,
            resolveAll(
              context.parser.constructs.insideSpan.null,
              events.slice(open + 1, index),
              context
            )
          )

          // Closing.
          nextEvents = push(nextEvents, [
            // …
          ])

          // …
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // …
}
```

## API

This module exports the identifier [`resolveAll`][api-resolve-all].
There is no default export.

### `resolveAll(constructs, events, context)`

Call all `resolveAll`s in `constructs`.

###### Parameters

*   `constructs` (`Array<Construct>`)
    — list of constructs, optionally with `resolveAll`s
*   `events` (`Array<Event>`)
    — list of events
*   `context` (`TokenizeContext`)
    — context used by `tokenize`

###### Returns

Changed events (`Array<Events>`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`micromark-util-resolve-all@^2`, compatible with Node.js 16.
This package works with `micromark@^3`.

## Security

This package is safe.
See [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to
submit a security report.

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.
See [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to make URLs safe.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-sanitize-uri
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {sanitizeUri} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-sanitize-uri@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {sanitizeUri} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-sanitize-uri@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {sanitizeUri} from 'micromark-util-sanitize-uri'

sanitizeUri('https://example.com/a&amp;b') // 'https://example.com/a&amp;amp;b'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/a%b') // 'https://example.com/a%25b'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/a%20b') // 'https://example.com/a%20b'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/👍') // 'https://example.com/%F0%9F%91%8D'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/', /^https?$/i) // 'https://example.com/'
sanitizeUri('javascript:alert(1)', /^https?$/i) // ''
sanitizeUri('./example.jpg', /^https?$/i) // './example.jpg'
sanitizeUri('#a', /^https?$/i) // '#a'
```

## API

This module exports the identifiers [`normalizeUri`][api-normalize-uri] and
[`sanitizeUri`][api-sanitize-uri].
There is no default export.

### `normalizeUri(value)`

Normalize a URL.

Encode unsafe characters with percent-encoding, skipping already encoded
sequences.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`)
    — URI to normalize

###### Returns

Normalized URI (`string`).

### `sanitizeUri(url[, pattern])`

Make a value safe for injection as a URL.

This encodes unsafe characters with percent-encoding and skips already
encoded sequences (see [`normalizeUri`][api-normalize-uri]).
Further unsafe characters are encoded as character references (see
[`micromark-util-encode`][micromark-util-encode]).

A regex of allowed protocols can be given, in which case the URL is sanitized.
For example, `/^(https?|ircs?|mailto|xmpp)$/i` can be used for `a[href]`, or
`/^https?$/i` for `img[src]` (this is what `github.com` allows).
If the URL includes an unknown protocol (one not matched by `protocol`, such
as a dangerous example, `javascript:`), the value is ignored.

###### Parameters

*   `url` (`string`)
    — URI to sanitize
*   `pattern` (`RegExp`, optional)
    — allowed protocols

###### Returns

Sanitized URI (`string`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 16+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This package works with `micromark` version 3+.

## Security

This package is safe.

## What is this?

This package exposes a micromark internal that you probably don’t need.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-subtokenize
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {subtokenize} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-subtokenize@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {subtokenize} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-subtokenize@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {subtokenize} from 'micromark-util-subtokenize'

/**
 * Content is transparent: it’s parsed right now. That way, definitions are also
 * parsed right now: before text in paragraphs (specifically, media) are parsed.
 *
 * @type {Resolver}
 */
function resolveContent(events) {
  subtokenize(events)
  return events
}
```

## API

This module exports the identifiers [`subtokenize`][api-subtokenize].
There is no default export.

### `subtokenize(events)`

Tokenize subcontent.

###### Parameters

*   `events` (`Array<Event>`)
    — list of events

###### Returns

Whether subtokens were found (`boolean`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`micromark-util-subtokenize@^2`, compatible with Node.js 16.
This package works with `micromark@^3`.

## Security

This package is safe.
See [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to
submit a security report.

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.
See [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.

This project has a [code of conduct][coc].

## What is this?

This package exposes constants used throughout the micromark ecosystem.

## When should I use this?

This package is useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.
It’s useful to reference these constants by name instead of value while
developing.
[`micromark-build`][micromark-build] compiles them away for production code.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-symbol
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {codes} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-symbol/codes@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {codes} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-symbol/codes@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {codes} from 'micromark-util-symbol/codes'
import {constants} from 'micromark-util-symbol/constants'
import {types} from 'micromark-util-symbol/types'
import {values} from 'micromark-util-symbol/values'

console.log(codes.atSign) // 64
console.log(constants.characterReferenceNamedSizeMax) // 31
console.log(types.definitionDestinationRaw) // 'definitionDestinationRaw'
console.log(values.atSign) // '@'
```

## API

This package has four entries in its export map: `micromark-util-symbol/codes`,
`micromark-util-symbol/constants`, `micromark-util-symbol/types`,
`micromark-util-symbol/values`.

Each module exports an identifier with the same name (for example,
`micromark-util-symbol/codes` has `codes`), which is an object mapping strings
to other values.

See the code for the exposed data.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 16+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This package works with `micromark` version 3+.

## Security

This package is safe.
See [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to
submit a security report.

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.
See [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.

This project has a [code of conduct][coc].
By interacting with this repository, organisation, or community you agree to
abide by its terms.

## When should I use this?

<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->

## What is this?

<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->

`micromark` is an open source markdown parser written in JavaScript.
It’s implemented as a state machine that emits concrete tokens, so that every
byte is accounted for, with positional info.
It then compiles those tokens directly to HTML, but other tools can take the
data and for example build an AST which is easier to work with
([`mdast-util-to-markdown`][mdast-util-to-markdown]).

While most markdown parsers work towards compliancy with CommonMark (or GFM),
this project goes further by following how the reference parsers (`cmark`,
`cmark-gfm`) work, which is confirmed with thousands of extra tests.

Other than CommonMark and GFM, micromark also supports common extensions to
markdown such as MDX, math, and frontmatter.

These npm packages have a sibling project in Rust:
[`markdown-rs`][markdown-rs].

*   to help, see [contribute][] and [sponsor][] below

## Install

<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {micromark} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {micromark} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->

Typical use (buffering):

```js
import {micromark} from 'micromark'

console.log(micromark('## Hello, *world*!'))
```

Yields:

```html
<h2>Hello, <em>world</em>!</h2>
```

You can pass extensions (in this case [`micromark-extension-gfm`][gfm]):

```js
import {micromark} from 'micromark'
import {gfm, gfmHtml} from 'micromark-extension-gfm'

const value = '* [x] contact@example.com ~~strikethrough~~'

const result = micromark(value, {
  extensions: [gfm()],
  htmlExtensions: [gfmHtml()]
})

console.log(result)
```

Yields:

```html
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> <a href="mailto:contact@example.com">contact@example.com</a> <del>strikethrough</del></li>
</ul>
```

Streaming interface:

```js
import {createReadStream} from 'node:fs'
import {stream} from 'micromark/stream'

createReadStream('example.md')
  .on('error', handleError)
  .pipe(stream())
  .pipe(process.stdout)

function handleError(error) {
  // Handle your error here!
  throw error
}
```

## API

`micromark` core has two entries in its export map: `micromark` and
`micromark/stream`.

`micromark` exports the identifier [`micromark`][api-micromark].
`micromark/stream` exports the identifier [`stream`][api-stream].
There are no default exports.

The export map supports the [`development` condition][development].
Run `node --conditions development module.js` to get instrumented dev code.
Without this condition, production code is loaded.
See [§ Size & debug][size-debug] for more info.

### `micromark(value[, encoding][, options])`

Compile markdown to HTML.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string` or [`Buffer`][buffer])
    — markdown to parse
*   `encoding` (`string`, default: `'utf8'`)
    — [character encoding][encoding] to understand `value` as when it’s a
    `Buffer`
*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
    — configuration

###### Returns

Compiled HTML (`string`).

### `stream(options?)`

Create a duplex (readable and writable) stream.

Some of the work to parse markdown can be done streaming, but in the
end buffering is required.

micromark does not handle errors for you, so you must handle errors on whatever
streams you pipe into it.
As markdown does not know errors, `micromark` itself does not emit errors.

###### Parameters

*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
    — configuration

###### Returns

Duplex stream.

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

##### Fields

###### `allowDangerousHtml`

Whether to allow (dangerous) HTML (`boolean`, default: `false`).

The default is `false`, which still parses the HTML according to `CommonMark`
but shows the HTML as text instead of as elements.

Pass `true` for trusted content to get actual HTML elements.
See [§ Security][security].

###### `allowDangerousProtocol`

Whether to allow dangerous protocols in links and images (`boolean`, default:
`false`).

The default is `false`, which drops URLs in links and images that use dangerous
protocols.

Pass `true` for trusted content to support all protocols.

URLs that have no protocol (which means it’s relative to the current page, such
as `./some/page.html`) and URLs that have a safe protocol (for images: `http`,
`https`; for links: `http`, `https`, `irc`, `ircs`, `mailto`, `xmpp`), are
safe.
All other URLs are dangerous and dropped.
See [§ Security][security].

###### `defaultLineEnding`

Default line ending to use when compiling to HTML, for line endings not in
`value` (`'\r'`, `'\n'`, or `'\r\n'`; default: first line ending or `'\n'`).

Generally, `micromark` copies line endings (`\r`, `\n`, `\r\n`) in the markdown
document over to the compiled HTML.
In some cases, such as `> a`, CommonMark requires that extra line endings are
added: `<blockquote>\n<p>a</p>\n</blockquote>`.

To create that line ending, the document is checked for the first line ending
that is used.
If there is no line ending, `defaultLineEnding` is used.
If that isn’t configured, `\n` is used.

###### `extensions`

Array of syntax extensions (`Array<SyntaxExtension>`, default: `[]`).
See [§ Extensions][extensions].

###### `htmlExtensions`

Array of syntax extensions (`Array<HtmlExtension>`, default: `[]`).
See [§ Extensions][extensions].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional type [`Options`][api-options].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `micromark@^4`, compatible
with Node.js 16.

napi-wasm 1.1.0
MIT
# napi-wasm

An implementation of the [napi](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html) API for WASM. Enables using some native Node modules in browsers and other environments.

## Setup

To use napi-wasm, there are a few requirements:

1. Configure your linker to export an indirect function table. With ldd, this is the `--export-table` flag. This enables JavaScript to call callback functions registered by WASM. It is exposed in the WebAssembly exports as `__indirect_function_table`.
2. Export a function from your WASM build named `napi_register_module_v1` (Node's default), or `napi_register_wasm_v1` for WASM-specific builds. This is called during initialization to setup the `exports` object for your module. It receives an environment and an exports object pointer as arguments, which you can add properties to.
3. Include a function named `napi_wasm_malloc` in your WASM build. This is called from JavaScript by napi-wasm to allocate memory in the WASM heap. It should accept a `uint32` size argument indicating the number of bytes to allocate, and return a `uint8` pointer to allocated memory.
4. Compile for the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.

### In Rust

The above steps should apply for any programming language, but here's an example in Rust. First, define a `napi_wasm_malloc` function so JavaScript can allocate memory in the WASM heap using the default allocator.

```rust
use std::alloc::{alloc, Layout};

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn napi_wasm_malloc(size: usize) -> *mut u8 {
  let align = std::mem::align_of::<usize>();
  if let Ok(layout) = Layout::from_size_align(size, align) {
    unsafe {
      if layout.size() > 0 {
        let ptr = alloc(layout);
        if !ptr.is_null() {
          return ptr;
        }
      } else {
        return align as *mut u8;
      }
    }
  }

  std::process::abort();
}
```

Next, implement `napi_register_wasm_v1` to register your module exports. We'll use the [napi-rs](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs) bindings in this example to make it a bit nicer than calling C APIs directly. Note that the napi-rs `#[module_exports]` macro currently doesn't work in WASM because Rust doesn't support ctor setup functions in WASM targets yet, so we'll need to do this manually.

```rust
use napi::{Env, JsObject, NapiValue};

#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn napi_register_wasm_v1(raw_env: napi::sys::napi_env, raw_exports: napi::sys::napi_value) {
  let env = Env::from_raw(raw_env);
  let exports = JsObject::from_raw_unchecked(raw_env, raw_exports);

  exports.create_named_method("transform", transform);
}

#[js_function(1)]
fn transform(ctx: CallContext) -> napi::Result<JsUnknown> {
  // ...
}
```

To compile, you need to export a function table and use the correct target.

```shell
 RUSTFLAGS="-C link-arg=--export-table" cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

This will output a file in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/YOUR_CRATE.wasm` which you can load in a JavaScript environment.

You can also put the rust flags in a `.cargo/config.toml` file so you don't need to provide the environment variable each time you run `cargo build`.

```toml
[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=--export-table"]
```

### Loading

To load a WASM file and initialize a napi environment, you'll need to import the `napi-wasm` package. You instantiate a WASM module as usual, providing `napi` as the `env` import key. This provides the napi functions for your WASM module to use.

Then, pass the WASM instance to the `Environment` constructor to setup a napi environment. This will call `napi_register_wasm_v1` or `napi_register_module_v1` to setup the exports object. Then you can call functions on the exports object as you would in Node.

```js
import { Environment, napi } from 'napi-wasm';

// Construct a URL and instantiate a WebAssembly module as usual.
const url = new URL('path/to/lib.wasm', import.meta.url);
const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch(url), {
  env: napi
});

// Create an environment.
let env = new Environment(instance);
let exports = env.exports;

// Use exports as usual!
exports.transform({
  // ...
});
```

When you are done with an `Environment`, call the `destroy()` function to clean up memory.


natural-compare 1.4.0

[Build]:    http://img.shields.io/travis/litejs/natural-compare-lite.png
[Coverage]: http://img.shields.io/coveralls/litejs/natural-compare-lite.png
[1]: https://travis-ci.org/litejs/natural-compare-lite
[2]: https://coveralls.io/r/litejs/natural-compare-lite
[npm package]: https://npmjs.org/package/natural-compare-lite
[GitHub repo]: https://github.com/litejs/natural-compare-lite



    @version    1.4.0
    @date       2015-10-26
    @stability  3 - Stable


Natural Compare &ndash; [![Build][]][1] [![Coverage][]][2]
===============

Compare strings containing a mix of letters and numbers
in the way a human being would in sort order.
This is described as a "natural ordering".

```text
Standard sorting:   Natural order sorting:
    img1.png            img1.png
    img10.png           img2.png
    img12.png           img10.png
    img2.png            img12.png
```

String.naturalCompare returns a number indicating
whether a reference string comes before or after or is the same
as the given string in sort order.
Use it with builtin sort() function.



### Installation

- In browser

```html
<script src=min.natural-compare.js></script>
```

- In node.js: `npm install natural-compare-lite`

```javascript
require("natural-compare-lite")
```

### Usage

```javascript
// Simple case sensitive example
var a = ["z1.doc", "z10.doc", "z17.doc", "z2.doc", "z23.doc", "z3.doc"];
a.sort(String.naturalCompare);
// ["z1.doc", "z2.doc", "z3.doc", "z10.doc", "z17.doc", "z23.doc"]

// Use wrapper function for case insensitivity
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.toLowerCase(), b.toLowerCase());
})

// In most cases we want to sort an array of objects
var a = [ {"street":"350 5th Ave", "room":"A-1021"}
        , {"street":"350 5th Ave", "room":"A-21046-b"} ];

// sort by street, then by room
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.street, b.street) || String.naturalCompare(a.room, b.room);
})

// When text transformation is needed (eg toLowerCase()),
// it is best for performance to keep
// transformed key in that object.
// There are no need to do text transformation
// on each comparision when sorting.
var a = [ {"make":"Audi", "model":"A6"}
        , {"make":"Kia",  "model":"Rio"} ];

// sort by make, then by model
a.map(function(car){
  car.sort_key = (car.make + " " + car.model).toLowerCase();
})
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.sort_key, b.sort_key);
})
```

- Works well with dates in ISO format eg "Rev 2012-07-26.doc".


### Custom alphabet

It is possible to configure a custom alphabet
to achieve a desired order.

```javascript
// Estonian alphabet
String.alphabet = "ABDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSŠZŽTUVÕÄÖÜXYabdefghijklmnoprsšzžtuvõäöüxy"
["t", "z", "x", "õ"].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// ["z", "t", "õ", "x"]

// Russian alphabet
String.alphabet = "АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя"
["Ё", "А", "Б"].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// ["А", "Б", "Ё"]
```

node-forge 1.3.1
(BSD-3-Clause OR GPL-2.0)
You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the
GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to
understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
Forge project.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under
that license.

You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
left intact.

If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
commercial entities for our efforts.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([rehype][]) plugin that defines how to take HTML
as input and turn it into a syntax tree.
When it’s used, HTML can be parsed and other rehype plugins can be used after
it.

See [the monorepo readme][rehype] for info on what the rehype ecosystem is.

## When should I use this?

This plugin adds support to unified for parsing HTML.
If you also need to serialize HTML, you can alternatively use
[`rehype`][rehype-core], which combines unified, this plugin, and
[`rehype-stringify`][rehype-stringify].

When you are in a browser, trust your content, don’t need positional info, and
value a smaller bundle size, you can use [`rehype-dom-parse`][rehype-dom-parse]
instead.

If you don’t use plugins and want to access the syntax tree, you can directly
use [`hast-util-from-html`][hast-util-from-html], which is used inside this
plugin.
rehype focusses on making it easier to transform content by abstracting such
internals away.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-parse
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import rehypeParse from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-parse@9'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeParse from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-parse@9?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say we have the following module `example.js`:

```js
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeRemark from 'rehype-remark'
import remarkStringify from 'remark-stringify'
import {unified} from 'unified'

const file = await unified()
  .use(rehypeParse)
  .use(rehypeRemark)
  .use(remarkStringify)
  .process('<h1>Hello, world!</h1>')

console.log(String(file))
```

…running that with `node example.js` yields:

```markdown
# Hello, world!
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is [`rehypeParse`][api-rehype-parse].

### `unified().use(rehypeParse[, options])`

Plugin to add support for parsing from HTML.

###### Parameters

*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)

###### Returns

Nothing (`undefined`).

### `ErrorCode`

Known names of [parse errors][parse-errors] (TypeScript type).

For a bit more info on each error, see

### `ErrorSeverity`

Error severity (TypeScript type).

*   `0` or `false`
    — turn the parse error off
*   `1` or `true`
    — turn the parse error into a warning
*   `2`
    — turn the parse error into an actual error: processing stops

###### Type

```ts
type ErrorSeverity = boolean | 0 | 1 | 2
```

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

> 👉 **Note**: this is not an XML parser.
> It supports SVG as embedded in HTML.
> It does not support the features available in XML.
> Passing SVG files might break but fragments of modern SVG should be fine.
> Use [`xast-util-from-xml`][xast-util-from-xml] to parse XML.

###### Fields

*   `fragment` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — whether to parse as a fragment; by default unopened `html`, `head`, and
    `body` elements are opened
*   `emitParseErrors` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — whether to emit [parse errors][parse-errors] while parsing
*   `space` (`'html'` or `'svg'`, default: `'html'`)
    — which space the document is in
*   `verbose` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — add extra positional info about attributes, start tags, and end tags
*   [`[key in ErrorCode]`][api-error-code]
    ([`ErrorSeverity`][api-error-severity], default: `1` if
    `options.emitParseErrors`, otherwise `0`)
    — configure specific [parse errors][parse-errors]

## Examples

### Example: fragment versus document

The following example shows the difference between parsing as a document and
parsing as a fragment:

```js
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
import {unified} from 'unified'

const doc = '<title>Hi!</title><h1>Hello!</h1>'

console.log(
  String(
    await unified()
      .use(rehypeParse, {fragment: true})
      .use(rehypeStringify)
      .process(doc)
  )
)

console.log(
  String(
    await unified()
      .use(rehypeParse, {fragment: false})
      .use(rehypeStringify)
      .process(doc)
  )
)
```

…yields:

```html
<title>Hi!</title><h1>Hello!</h1>
```

```html
<html><head><title>Hi!</title></head><body><h1>Hello!</h1></body></html>
```

> 👉 **Note**: observe that when a whole document is expected (second example),
> missing elements are opened and closed.

### Example: whitespace around and inside `<html>`

The following example shows how whitespace is handled when around and directly
inside the `<html>` element:

```js
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
import {unified} from 'unified'

const doc = `<!doctype html>
<html lang=en>
  <head>
    <title>Hi!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
  </body>
</html>`

console.log(
  String(await unified().use(rehypeParse).use(rehypeStringify).process(doc))
)
```

…yields (where `␠` represents a space character):

```html
<!doctype html><html lang="en"><head>
    <title>Hi!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
␠␠
</body></html>
```

> 👉 **Note**: observe that the line ending before `<html>` is ignored, the line
> ending and two spaces before `<head>` is moved inside it, and the line ending
> after `</body>` is moved before it.

This behavior is described by the HTML standard (see the section 13.2.6.4.1
“The ‘initial’ insertion mode” and adjacent states) which rehype follows.

The changes to this meaningless whitespace should not matter, except when
formatting markup, in which case [`rehype-format`][rehype-format] can be used to
improve the source code.

### Example: parse errors

The following example shows how HTML parse errors can be enabled and configured:

```js
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'

const file = await unified()
  .use(rehypeParse, {
    emitParseErrors: true, // Emit all.
    missingWhitespaceBeforeDoctypeName: 2, // Mark one as a fatal error.
    nonVoidHtmlElementStartTagWithTrailingSolidus: false // Ignore one.
  })
  .use(rehypeStringify).process(`<!doctypehtml>
<title class="a" class="b">Hello…</title>
<h1/>World!</h1>`)

console.log(reporter(file))
```

…yields:

```html
1:10-1:10 error   Missing whitespace before doctype name missing-whitespace-before-doctype-name hast-util-from-html
2:23-2:23 warning Unexpected duplicate attribute         duplicate-attribute                    hast-util-from-html

2 messages (✖ 1 error, ⚠ 1 warning)
```

> 🧑‍🏫 **Info**: messages in unified are warnings instead of errors.
> Other linters (such as ESLint) almost always use errors.
> Why?
> Those tools *only* check code style.
> They don’t generate, transform, and format code, which is what rehype and
> unified focus on, too.
> Errors in unified mean the same as an exception in your JavaScript code: a
> crash.
> That’s why we use warnings instead, because we continue checking more HTML and
> continue running more plugins.

## Syntax

HTML is parsed according to WHATWG HTML (the living standard), which is also
followed by all browsers.

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree format used in rehype is [hast][].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional types [`ErrorCode`][api-error-code],
[`ErrorSeverity`][api-error-severity], and
[`Options`][api-options].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `rehype-parse@^9`,
compatible with Node.js 16.

## Security

As **rehype** works on HTML and improper use of HTML can open you up to a
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of rehype can also be unsafe.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to make the tree safe.

Use of rehype plugins could also open you up to other attacks.
Carefully assess each plugin and the risks involved in using them.

For info on how to submit a report, see our [security policy][security].

## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([rehype][]) plugin that defines how to take a
syntax tree as input and turn it into serialized HTML.
When it’s used, HTML is serialized as the final result.

See [the monorepo readme][rehype] for info on what the rehype ecosystem is.

## When should I use this?

This plugin adds support to unified for serializing HTML.
If you also need to parse HTML, you can alternatively use
[`rehype`][rehype-core], which combines unified,
[`rehype-parse`][rehype-parse], and this plugin.

When you are in a browser, trust your content, don’t need formatting options,
and value a smaller bundle size, you can use
[`rehype-dom-stringify`][rehype-dom-stringify] instead.

If you don’t use plugins and have access to a syntax tree, you can directly use
[`hast-util-to-html`][hast-util-to-html], which is used inside this plugin.
rehype focusses on making it easier to transform content by abstracting such
internals away.

A different plugin, [`rehype-format`][rehype-format], improves the readability
of HTML source code as it adds insignificant but pretty whitespace between
elements.
There is also the preset [`rehype-minify`][rehype-minify] for when you want the
inverse: minified and mangled HTML.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-stringify
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import rehypeStringify from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-stringify@10'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeStringify from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-stringify@10?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say we have the following module `example.js`:

```js
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import {unified} from 'unified'

const file = await unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkGfm)
  .use(remarkRehype)
  .use(rehypeStringify)
  .process('# Hi\n\n*Hello*, world!')

console.log(String(file))
```

…running that with `node example.js` yields:

```html
<h1>Hi</h1>
<p><em>Hello</em>, world!</p>
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is [`rehypeStringify`][api-rehype-stringify].

### `unified().use(rehypeStringify[, options])`

Plugin to add support for serializing to HTML.

###### Parameters

*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
    — configuration

###### Returns

Nothing (`undefined`).

### `CharacterReferences`

How to serialize character references (TypeScript type).

> ⚠️ **Note**: `omitOptionalSemicolons` creates what HTML calls “parse errors”
> but is otherwise still valid HTML — don’t use this except when building a
> minifier.
> Omitting semicolons is possible for certain named and numeric references in
> some cases.

> ⚠️ **Note**: `useNamedReferences` can be omitted when using
> `useShortestReferences`.

###### Fields

*   `useNamedReferences` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — prefer named character references (`&amp;`) where possible
*   `omitOptionalSemicolons` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — whether to omit semicolons when possible
*   `useShortestReferences` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — prefer the shortest possible reference, if that results in less bytes

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

> ⚠️ **Danger**: only set `allowDangerousCharacters` and `allowDangerousHtml` if
> you completely trust the content.

> 👉 **Note**: `allowParseErrors`, `bogusComments`, `tightAttributes`, and
> `tightDoctype`
> intentionally create parse errors in markup (how parse errors are handled is
> well defined, so this works but isn’t pretty).

> 👉 **Note**: this is not an XML serializer.
> It supports SVG as embedded in HTML.
> It does not support the features available in XML.
> Use [`xast-util-to-xml`][xast-util-to-xml] to serialize XML.

###### Fields

*   `allowDangerousCharacters` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — do not encode some characters which cause XSS vulnerabilities in older
    browsers
*   `allowDangerousHtml` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — allow [`Raw`][raw] nodes and insert them as raw HTML; when `false`, `Raw`
    nodes are encoded
*   `allowParseErrors` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — do not encode characters which cause parse errors (even though they
    work), to save bytes; not used in the SVG space.
*   `bogusComments` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — use “bogus comments” instead of comments to save byes: `<?charlie>`
    instead of `<!--charlie-->`
*   `characterReferences` ([`CharacterReferences`][api-character-references],
    optional)
    — configure how to serialize character references
*   `closeEmptyElements` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — close SVG elements without any content with slash (`/`) on the opening
    tag instead of an end tag: `<circle />` instead of `<circle></circle>`;
    see `tightSelfClosing` to control whether a space is used before the slash;
    not used in the HTML space
*   `closeSelfClosing` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — close self-closing nodes with an extra slash (`/`): `<img />` instead of
    `<img>`; see `tightSelfClosing` to control whether a space is used before
    the slash; not used in the SVG space.
*   `collapseEmptyAttributes` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — collapse empty attributes: get `class` instead of `class=""`; not used in
    the SVG space; boolean attributes (such as `hidden`) are always collapsed
*   `omitOptionalTags` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — omit optional opening and closing tags; to illustrate, in
    `<ol><li>one</li><li>two</li></ol>`, both `</li>` closing tags can be
    omitted, the first because it’s followed by another `li`, the last because
    it’s followed by nothing; not used in the SVG space
*   `preferUnquoted` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — leave attributes unquoted if that results in less bytes; not used in the
    SVG space
*   `quote` (`'"'` or `"'"`, default: `'"'`)
    — preferred quote to use
*   `quoteSmart` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — use the other quote if that results in less bytes
*   `space` (`'html'` or `'svg'`, default: `'html'`)
    — which space the document is in; when an `<svg>` element is found in the
    HTML space, this package already automatically switches to and from the SVG
*   `tightAttributes` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — join attributes together, without whitespace, if possible: get
    `class="a b"title="c d"` instead of `class="a b" title="c d"` to save
    bytes; not used in the SVG space
*   `tightCommaSeparatedLists` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — join known comma-separated attribute values with just a comma (`,`),
    instead of padding them on the right as well (`,␠`, where `␠` represents a
    space)
*   `tightDoctype` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    — drop unneeded spaces in doctypes: `<!doctypehtml>` instead of
    `<!doctype html>` to save bytes
*   `tightSelfClosing` (`boolean`, default: `false`).
    — do not use an extra space when closing self-closing elements: `<img/>`
    instead of `<img />`; only used if `closeSelfClosing: true` or
    `closeEmptyElements: true`
*   `upperDoctype` (`boolean`, default: `false`).
    — use a `<!DOCTYPE…` instead of `<!doctype…`; useless except for XHTML
*   `voids` (`Array<string>`, default:
    [`html-void-elements`][html-void-elements])
    — tag names of elements to serialize without closing tag; not used in the
    SVG space

## Syntax

HTML is serialized according to WHATWG HTML (the living standard), which is also
followed by all browsers.

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree format used in rehype is [hast][].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional types
[`CharacterReferences`][api-character-references] and
[`Options`][api-options].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `rehype-stringify@^10`,
compatible with Node.js 16.

## Security

As **rehype** works on HTML, and improper use of HTML can open you up to a
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of rehype can also be unsafe.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to make the tree safe.

Use of rehype plugins could also open you up to other attacks.
Carefully assess each plugin and the risks involved in using them.

For info on how to submit a report, see our [security policy][security].

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`rehypejs/.github`][health] for ways

      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier

# Simple Git

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/simple-git.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-git)

A lightweight interface for running `git` commands in any [node.js](https://nodejs.org) application.

# Installation

Use your favourite package manager:

-  [npm](https://npmjs.org): `npm install simple-git`
-  [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): `yarn add simple-git`

# System Dependencies

Requires [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to be installed and that it can be called using the command `git`.

# Usage

Include into your JavaScript app using common js:

```javascript
// require the library, main export is a function
const simpleGit = require('simple-git');
simpleGit().clean(simpleGit.CleanOptions.FORCE);

// or use named properties
const { simpleGit, CleanOptions } = require('simple-git');
simpleGit().clean(CleanOptions.FORCE);
```

Include into your JavaScript app as an ES Module:

```javascript
import { simpleGit, CleanOptions } from 'simple-git';

simpleGit().clean(CleanOptions.FORCE);
```

Include in a TypeScript app using the bundled type definitions:

```typescript
import { simpleGit, SimpleGit, CleanOptions } from 'simple-git';

const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit().clean(CleanOptions.FORCE);
```

## Configuration

Configure each `simple-git` instance with a properties object passed to the main `simpleGit` function:

```typescript
import { simpleGit, SimpleGit, SimpleGitOptions } from 'simple-git';

const options: Partial<SimpleGitOptions> = {
   baseDir: process.cwd(),
   binary: 'git',
   maxConcurrentProcesses: 6,
   trimmed: false,
};

// when setting all options in a single object
const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit(options);

// or split out the baseDir, supported for backward compatibility
const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit('/some/path', { binary: 'git' });
```

The first argument can be either a string (representing the working directory for `git` commands to run in),
`SimpleGitOptions` object or `undefined`, the second parameter is an optional `SimpleGitOptions` object.

All configuration properties are optional, the default values are shown in the example above.

## Per-command Configuration

To prefix the commands run by `simple-git` with custom configuration not saved in the git config (ie: using the
`-c` command) supply a `config` option to the instance builder:

```typescript
// configure the instance with a custom configuration property
const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit('/some/path', { config: ['http.proxy=someproxy'] });

// any command executed will be prefixed with this config
// runs: git -c http.proxy=someproxy pull
await git.pull();
```

## Configuring Plugins

- [AbortController](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-ABORT-CONTROLLER.md)
   Terminate pending and future tasks in a `simple-git` instance (requires node >= 16).

- [Completion Detection](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-COMPLETION-DETECTION.md)
   Customise how `simple-git` detects the end of a `git` process.

- [Error Detection](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-ERRORS.md)
   Customise the detection of errors from the underlying `git` process.

- [Progress Events](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-PROGRESS-EVENTS.md)
   Receive progress events as `git` works through long-running processes.

- [Spawned Process Ownership](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-SPAWN-OPTIONS.md)
   Configure the system `uid` / `gid` to use for spawned `git` processes.

- [Timeout](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-TIMEOUT.md)
   Automatically kill the wrapped `git` process after a rolling timeout.

- [Unsafe](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-UNSAFE-ACTIONS.md)
   Selectively opt out of `simple-git` safety precautions - for advanced users and use cases.

## Using Task Promises

Each task in the API returns the `simpleGit` instance for chaining together multiple tasks, and each
step in the chain is also a `Promise` that can be `await` ed in an `async` function or returned in a
`Promise` chain.

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();

// chain together tasks to await final result
await git.init().addRemote('origin', '...remote.git');

// or await each step individually
await git.init();
await git.addRemote('origin', '...remote.git');
```

### Catching errors in async code

To catch errors in async code, either wrap the whole chain in a try/catch:

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();
try {
   await git.init();
   await git.addRemote(name, repoUrl);
} catch (e) {
   /* handle all errors here */
}
```

or catch individual steps to permit the main chain to carry on executing rather than
jumping to the final `catch` on the first error:

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();
try {
   await git.init().catch(ignoreError);
   await git.addRemote(name, repoUrl);
} catch (e) {
   /* handle all errors here */
}

function ignoreError() {}
```

## Using Task Callbacks

In addition to returning a promise, each method can also be called with a trailing callback argument
to handle the result of the task.

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();
git.init(onInit).addRemote('origin', 'git@github.com:steveukx/git-js.git', onRemoteAdd);

function onInit(err, initResult) {}
function onRemoteAdd(err, addRemoteResult) {}
```

If any of the steps in the chain result in an error, all pending steps will be cancelled, see the
[parallel tasks](<(#concurrent--parallel-requests)>) section for more information on how to run tasks in parallel rather than in series .

## Task Responses

Whether using a trailing callback or a Promise, tasks either return the raw `string` or `Buffer` response from the
`git` binary, or where possible a parsed interpretation of the response.

For type details of the response for each of the tasks, please see the [TypeScript definitions](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/simple-git.d.ts).

# Upgrading from Version 2

From v3 of `simple-git` you can now import as an ES module, Common JS module or as TypeScript with bundled type
definitions. Upgrading from v2 will be seamless for any application not relying on APIs that were marked as deprecated
in v2 (deprecation notices were logged to `stdout` as `console.warn` in v2).

-  `.clone(repoPath, [options])` clone a remote repo at `repoPath` to a directory in the current working directory with the same name as the repo

-  `mirror(repoPath, [localPath, [options]])` behaves the same as the `.clone` interface with the [`--mirror` flag](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---mirror) enabled.

## git config

-  `.addConfig(key, value, append = false, scope = 'local')` add a local configuration property, when `append` is set to
   `true` the configuration setting is appended to rather than overwritten in the local config. Use the `scope` argument
   to pick where to save the new configuration setting (use the exported `GitConfigScope` enum, or equivalent string
   values - `worktree | local | global | system`).
-  `.getConfig(key)` get the value(s) for a named key as a [ConfigGetResult](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/response.d.ts)
-  `.getConfig(key, scope)` get the value(s) for a named key as a [ConfigGetResult](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/response.d.ts) but limit the
   scope of the properties searched to a single specified scope (use the exported `GitConfigScope` enum, or equivalent
   string values - `worktree | local | global | system`)

-  `.listConfig()` reads the current configuration and returns a [ConfigListSummary](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/src/lib/responses/ConfigList.ts)
-  `.listConfig(scope: GitConfigScope)` as with `listConfig` but returns only those items in a specified scope (note that configuration values are overlaid on top of each other to build the config `git` will actually use - to resolve the configuration you are using use `(await listConfig()).all` without the scope argument)

## git diff

-  `.diff([ options ])` get the diff of the current repo compared to the last commit, optionally including
   any number of other arguments supported by [git diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) supplied as an
   [options](#how-to-specify-options) object/array. Returns the raw `diff` output as a string.

-  `.diffSummary([ options ])` creates a [DiffResult](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/src/lib/responses/DiffSummary.ts)
   to summarise the diff for files in the repo. Uses the `--stat` format by default which can be overridden
   by passing in any of the log format commands (eg: `--numstat` or `--name-stat`) as part of the optional
   [options](#how-to-specify-options) object/array.

## git grep [examples](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/examples/git-grep.md)

   outside of the work tree), optionally writing the resulting value to the object database.

## git init

-  `.init(bare , [options])` initialize a repository using the boolean `bare` parameter to intialise a bare repository.
   Any number of other arguments supported by [git init](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init) can be supplied as an
   [options](#how-to-specify-options) object/array.

-  `.init([options])` initialize a repository using any arguments supported by
   [git init](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init) supplied as an [options](#how-to-specify-options) object/array.

## git log

-  `.log([options])` list commits between `options.from` and `options.to` tags or branch (if not specified will
   show all history). Use the `options` object to set any [options](#how-to-specify-options) supported by the
   [git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) command or any of the following:

   -  `options.file` - the path to a file in your repository to only consider this path.
   -  `options.format` - custom log format object, keys are the property names used on the returned object, values are the format string from [pretty formats](https://git-scm.com/docs/pretty-formats#Documentation/pretty-formats.txt)
   -  `options.from` - sets the oldest commit in the range to return, use along with `options.to` to set a bounded range
   -  `options.mailMap` - defaults to true, enables the use of [mail map](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmailmap) in returned values for email and name from the default format
   -  `options.maxCount` - equivalent to setting the `--max-count` option
   -  `options.multiLine` - enables multiline body values in the default format (disabled by default)
   -  `options.splitter` - the character sequence to use as a delimiter between fields in the log, should be a value that doesn't appear in any log message (defaults to `ò`)
   -  `options.strictDate` - switches the authored date value from an ISO 8601-like format to be strict ISO 8601 format
   -  `options.symmetric` - defaults to true, enables [symmetric revision range](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions#_dotted_range_notations) rather than a two-dot range
   -  `options.to` - sets the newset commit in the range to return, use along with `options.from` to set a bounded range
   
   When only one of `options.from` and `options.to` is supplied, the default value of the omitted option is equivalent to `HEAD`. For any other commit, explicitly supply both from and to commits (for example use `await git.firstCommit()` as the default value of `from` to log since the first commit of the repo). 

## git merge

-  `.merge(options)` runs a merge using any configuration [options](#how-to-specify-options) supported
   by [git merge](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge).

## git status

-  `.status([options])` gets the status of the current repo, resulting in a [StatusResult](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/response.d.ts). Additional arguments
   supported by [git status](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) can be supplied as an [options](#how-to-specify-options) object/array.

## changing the working directory [examples](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/examples/git-change-working-directory.md)

-  `.cwd(workingDirectory)` Sets the working directory for all future commands - note, this will change the working for the root instance, any chain created from the root will also be changed.
-  `.cwd({ path, root = false })` Sets the working directory for all future commands either in the current chain of commands (where `root` is omitted or set to `false`) or in the main instance (where `root` is `true`).

## How to Specify Options

Where the task accepts custom options (eg: `pull` or `commit`), these can be supplied as an object, the keys of which
will all be merged as trailing arguments in the command string, or as a simple array of strings.

### Options as an Object

When the value of the property in the options object is a `string`, that name value
pair will be included in the command string as `name=value`. For example:

```javascript
// results in 'git pull origin master --no-rebase'
git.pull('origin', 'master', { '--no-rebase': null });

// results in 'git pull origin master --rebase=true'
git.pull('origin', 'master', { '--rebase': 'true' });
```

### Options as an Array

Options can also be supplied as an array of strings to be merged into the task's commands
in the same way as when an object is used:

```javascript
// results in 'git pull origin master --no-rebase'
git.pull('origin', 'master', ['--no-rebase']);
```

# Release History

Major release 3.x changes the packaging of the library, making it consumable as a CommonJS module, ES module as well as
with TypeScript (see [usage](#usage) above). The library is now published as a single file, so please ensure your
application hasn't been making use of non-documented APIs by importing from a sub-directory path.

See also:

- [release notes v3](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/CHANGELOG.md)
- [release notes v2](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/RELEASE-NOTES-V2.md)

# Concurrent / Parallel Requests

When the methods of `simple-git` are chained together, they create an execution chain that will run in series, useful
for when the tasks themselves are order-dependent, eg:

```typescript
simpleGit().init().addRemote('origin', 'https://some-repo.git').fetch();
```

Each task requires that the one before it has been run successfully before it is called, any errors in a
step of the chain should prevent later steps from being attempted.

When the methods of `simple-git` are called on the root instance (ie: `git = simpleGit()`) rather than chained
off another task, it starts a new chain and will not be affected failures in tasks already being run. Useful
for when the tasks are independent of each other, eg:

```typescript
const git = simpleGit();
const results = await Promise.all([
   git.raw('rev-parse', '--show-cdup').catch(swallow),
   git.raw('rev-parse', '--show-prefix').catch(swallow),
]);
function swallow(err) {
   return null;
}
```

Each `simple-git` instance limits the number of spawned child processes that can be run simultaneously and
manages the queue of pending tasks for you. Configure this value by passing an options object to the
`simpleGit` function, eg:

```typescript
const git = simpleGit({ maxConcurrentProcesses: 10 });
```

Treating tasks called on the root instance as the start of separate chains is a change to the behaviour of
`simple-git` and was added in version `2.11.0`.

# Complex Requests

When no suitable wrapper exists in the interface for creating a request, run the command directly
using `git.raw([...], handler)`. The array of commands are passed directly to the `git` binary:

```javascript
const path = '/path/to/repo';
const commands = ['config', '--global', 'advice.pushNonFastForward', 'false'];

// using an array of commands and node-style callback
simpleGit(path).raw(commands, (err, result) => {
   // err is null unless this command failed
   // result is the raw output of this command
});

// using a var-args of strings and awaiting rather than using the callback
const result = await simpleGit(path).raw(...commands);

// automatically trim trailing white-space in responses
const result = await simpleGit(path, { trimmed: true }).raw(...commands);
```

# Authentication

The easiest way to supply a username / password to the remote host is to include it in the URL, for example:

```javascript
const USER = 'something';
const PASS = 'somewhere';
const REPO = 'github.com/username/private-repo';

const remote = `https://${USER}:${PASS}@${REPO}`;

simpleGit()
   .clone(remote)
   .then(() => console.log('finished'))
   .catch((err) => console.error('failed: ', err));
```

Be sure to not enable debug logging when using this mechanism for authentication
to ensure passwords aren't logged to stdout.

# Environment Variables

Pass one or more environment variables to the child processes spawned by `simple-git` with the `.env` method which
supports passing either an object of name=value pairs or setting a single variable at a time:

```javascript
const GIT_SSH_COMMAND = 'ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no';

simpleGit()
   .env('GIT_SSH_COMMAND', GIT_SSH_COMMAND)
   .status((err, status) => {
      /*  */
   });

simpleGit()
   .env({ ...process.env, GIT_SSH_COMMAND })
   .status()
   .then((status) => {})
   .catch((err) => {});
```

Note - when passing environment variables into the child process, these will replace the standard `process.env`
variables, the example above creates a new object based on `process.env` but with the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` property added.

# Exception Handling

When the `git` process exits with a non-zero status (or in some cases like `merge` the git process exits with a
successful zero code but there are conflicts in the merge) the task will reject with a `GitError` when there is no
available parser to handle the error or a
`GitResponseError` for when there is.

See the `err` property of the callback:

```javascript
git.merge((err, mergeSummary) => {
   if (err.git) {
      mergeSummary = err.git; // the failed mergeSummary
   }
});
```

Catch errors with try/catch in async code:

```javascript
try {
   const mergeSummary = await git.merge();
   console.log(`Merged ${mergeSummary.merges.length} files`);
} catch (err) {
   // err.message - the string summary of the error
   // err.stack - some stack trace detail
   // err.git - where a parser was able to run, this is the parsed content

   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${err.git.conflicts.length} conflicts`);
}
```

Catch errors with a `.catch` on the promise:

```javascript
const mergeSummary = await git.merge().catch((err) => {
   if (err.git) {
      return err.git;
   } // the unsuccessful mergeSummary
   throw err; // some other error, so throw
});

if (mergeSummary.failed) {
   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${mergeSummary.conflicts.length} conflicts`);
}
```

With typed errors available in TypeScript

```typescript
import { simpleGit, MergeSummary, GitResponseError } from 'simple-git';
try {
   const mergeSummary = await simpleGit().merge();
   console.log(`Merged ${mergeSummary.merges.length} files`);
} catch (err) {
   // err.message - the string summary of the error
   // err.stack - some stack trace detail
   // err.git - where a parser was able to run, this is the parsed content
   const mergeSummary: MergeSummary = (err as GitResponseError<MergeSummary>).git;
   const conflicts = mergeSummary?.conflicts || [];

   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${conflicts.length} conflicts`);
}
```

See the [debug logging guide](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/DEBUG-LOGGING-GUIDE.md#verbose-logging-options) for
the full list of verbose logging options to use with the
[debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library.

### Every command returns ENOENT error message

There are a few potential reasons:

-  `git` isn't available as a binary for the user running the main `node` process, custom paths to the binary can be used
   with the `.customBinary(...)` API option.

-  the working directory passed in to the main `simple-git` function isn't accessible, check it is read/write accessible
   by the user running the `node` process. This library uses
   [@kwsites/file-exists](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kwsites/file-exists) to validate the working directory exists,
   to output its logs add `@kwsites/file-exists` to your `DEBUG` environment variable. eg:

   `DEBUG=@kwsites/file-exists,simple-git node ./your-app.js`

### Log format fails

The properties of `git log` are fetched using the `--pretty=format` argument which supports different tokens depending
on the version of `git` - for example the `%D` token used to show the refs was added in git `2.2.3`, for any version
before that please ensure you are supplying your own format object with properties supported by the version of git you
are using.

For more details of the supported tokens, please see the
[official `git log` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_pretty_formats)

### Log response properties are out of order

The properties of `git.log` are fetched using the character sequence `ò` as a delimiter. If your commit messages
use this sequence, supply a custom `splitter` in the options, for example: `git.log({ splitter: '💻' })`

### Pull / Diff / Merge summary responses don't recognise any files

-  Enable verbose logs with the environment variable `DEBUG=simple-git:task:*,simple-git:output:*`
-  Check the output (for example: `simple-git:output:diff:1 [stdOut] 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)`)
-  Check the `stdOut` output is the same as you would expect to see when running the command directly in terminal
-  Check the language used in the response is english locale

In some cases `git` will show progress messages or additional detail on error states in the output for
`stdErr` that will help debug your issue, these messages are also included in the verbose log.

### Legacy Node Versions

From `v3.x`, `simple-git` will drop support for `node.js` version 10 or below, to use in a lower version of node will
result in errors such as:

-  `Object.fromEntries is not a function`
-  `Object.entries is not a function`
-  `message.flatMap is not a function`

To resolve these issues, either upgrade to a newer version of node.js or ensure you are using the necessary polyfills
from `core-js` - see [Legacy Node Versions](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/LEGACY_NODE_VERSIONS.md).

# Examples

### using a pathspec to limit the scope of the task

If the `simple-git` API doesn't explicitly limit the scope of the task being run (ie: `git.add()` requires the files to
be added, but `git.status()` will run against the entire repo), add a `pathspec` to the command using trailing options:

```typescript
import { simpleGit, pathspec } from "simple-git";

const git = simpleGit();
const wholeRepoStatus = await git.status();
const subDirStatusUsingOptArray = await git.status([pathspec('sub-dir')]);
const subDirStatusUsingOptObject = await git.status({ 'sub-dir': pathspec('sub-dir') });
```

### async await

```javascript
async function status(workingDir) {
   let statusSummary = null;
   try {
      statusSummary = await simpleGit(workingDir).status();
   } catch (e) {
      // handle the error
   }

   return statusSummary;
}

// using the async function
status(__dirname + '/some-repo').then((status) => console.log(status));
```

### Initialise a git repo if necessary

```javascript
const git = simpleGit(__dirname);

git.checkIsRepo()
   .then((isRepo) => !isRepo && initialiseRepo(git))
   .then(() => git.fetch());

function initialiseRepo(git) {
   return git.init().then(() => git.addRemote('origin', 'https://some.git.repo'));
}
```

### Update repo and get a list of tags

```javascript
simpleGit(__dirname + '/some-repo')
   .pull()
   .tags((err, tags) => console.log('Latest available tag: %s', tags.latest));

// update repo and when there are changes, restart the app
simpleGit().pull((err, update) => {
   if (update && update.summary.changes) {
      require('child_process').exec('npm restart');
   }
});
```

### Starting a new repo

```javascript
simpleGit()
   .init()
   .add('./*')
   .commit('first commit!')
   .addRemote('origin', 'https://github.com/user/repo.git')
   .push('origin', 'master');
```

### push with `-u`

```javascript
simpleGit()
   .add('./*')
   .commit('first commit!')
   .addRemote('origin', 'some-repo-url')
   .push(['-u', 'origin', 'master'], () => console.log('done'));
```

### Piping to the console for long-running tasks

See [progress events](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-PROGRESS-EVENTS.md) for more details on
logging progress updates.

```javascript
const git = simpleGit({
   progress({ method, stage, progress }) {
      console.log(`git.${method} ${stage} stage ${progress}% complete`);
   },
});
git.checkout('https://github.com/user/repo.git');
```

### Update repo and print messages when there are changes, restart the app

```javascript
// when using a chain
simpleGit()
   .exec(() => console.log('Starting pull...'))
   .pull((err, update) => {
      if (update && update.summary.changes) {
         require('child_process').exec('npm restart');
      }
   })
   .exec(() => console.log('pull done.'));

// when using async and optional chaining
const git = simpleGit();
console.log('Starting pull...');
if ((await git.pull())?.summary.changes) {
   require('child_process').exec('npm restart');
}
console.log('pull done.');
```

### Get a full commits list, and then only between 0.11.0 and 0.12.0 tags

```javascript
console.log(await simpleGit().log());
console.log(await simpleGit().log('0.11.0', '0.12.0'));
```

### Set the local configuration for author, then author for an individual commit

```javascript
simpleGit()
   .addConfig('user.name', 'Some One')
   .addConfig('user.email', 'some@one.com')
   .commit('committed as "Some One"', 'file-one')
   .commit('committed as "Another Person"', 'file-two', {
      '--author': '"Another Person <another@person.com>"',
   });
```

### Get remote repositories

```javascript
simpleGit().listRemote(['--get-url'], (err, data) => {
   if (!err) {
      console.log('Remote url for repository at ' + __dirname + ':');
      console.log(data);
   }
});
```


sirv 2.0.3

# sirv ![CI](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

> The optimized and lightweight middleware for serving requests to static assets

You may use `sirv` as a *very* fast and lightweight alternative to [`serve-static`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static).

The massive performance advantage over `serve-static` is explained by **not** relying on the file system for existence checks on every request. These are expensive interactions and must be avoided whenever possible! Instead, when not in "dev" mode, `sirv` performs all its file-system operations upfront and then relies on its cache for future operations.

This middleware will work out of the box for [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka), Express, and other Express-like frameworks. It will also work with the native `http`, `https` and `http2` modules. It requires _very_ little effort to modify/wrap it for servers that don't accept the `(req, res, next)` signature.

:bulb: For a feature-complete CLI application, check out the sibling [`sirv-cli`](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/tree/master/packages/sirv-cli) package as an alternative to [`zeit/serve`](https://github.com/zeit/serve)~!

## Install

```
$ npm install --save sirv
```


## Usage

```js
const sirv = require('sirv');
const polka = require('polka');
const compress = require('compression')();

// Init `sirv` handler
const assets = sirv('public', {
  maxAge: 31536000, // 1Y
  immutable: true
});

polka()
  .use(compress, assets)
  .use('/api', require('./api'))
  .listen(3000, err => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('> Ready on localhost:3000~!');
  });
```


## API

### sirv(dir, opts={})

Returns: `Function`

The returned function is a middleware in the standard Express-like signature: `(req, res, next)`, where `req` is the [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), `res` is the [`http.ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v9.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), and `next` (in this case) is the function to call if no file was found for the given path.

When defined, a `next()` callback is always called _instead of_ the [`opts.onNoMatch`](#optsonnomatch) callback. However, unlike `onNoMatch`, your `next()` is given no arguments.

#### dir
Type: `String`<br>
Default: `.`

The directory from which to read and serve assets. It is resolved to an absolute path &mdash; you must provide an absolute path yourself if `process.cwd()` is not the correct assumption.

#### opts.dev
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Enable "dev" mode, which disables/skips caching. Instead, `sirv` will traverse the file system ***on every request***.

Additionally, `dev` mode will ignore `maxAge` and `immutable` as these options generate a production-oriented `Cache-Control` header value.

> **Important:** Do not use `dev` mode in production!

#### opts.etag
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Generate and attach an `ETag` header to responses.

> **Note:** If an incoming request's [`If-None-Match` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match) matches the `ETag` value, a `304` response is given.

#### opts.dotfiles
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Allow requests to dotfiles (files or directories beginning with a `.`).

> **Note:** Requests to [`/.well-known/*`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615) are always allowed.

#### opts.extensions
Type: `Array<String>`<br>
Default: `['html', 'htm']`

The file extension fallbacks to check for if a pathame is not initially found. For example, if a `/login` request cannot find a `login` filename, it will then look for `login.html` and `login.htm` before giving up~!

> **Important:** Actually, `sirv` will **also** look for `login/index.html` and `login/index.htm` before giving up.

#### opts.gzip
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Determine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.gz` files.<br>
Must be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include "gzip" in order for `sirv` to search for the gzip'd alternative.

> **Note:** The `.gz` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.

```js
// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE
// Showing lookup logic

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] "/foobar.jpg"
lookup([
  '/foobar.jpg.gz', '/foobar.jpg',
  '/foobar.jpg.html.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.gz',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.gz',
  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',
]);

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] "/"
lookup([
  '/index.html.gz',
  '/index.htm.gz',
  '/index.html',
  '/index.htm',
]);
```


#### opts.brotli
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Determine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.br` files.<br>
Must be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include either "br" or "brotli" in order for `sirv` to search for the brotli-compressed alternative.

> **Note:** The `.br` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.

When both `opts.broli` and `opts.gzip` are enabled &mdash; and all conditions are equal &mdash; then the brotli variant always takes priority.

```js
// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE
// Showing lookup logic

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br] "/foobar.jpg"
lookup([
  '/foobar.jpg.br', '/foobar.jpg',
  '/foobar.jpg.html.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.br',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.br',
  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',
]);

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br,gz] "/"
lookup([
  '/index.html.br'
  '/index.htm.br'
  '/index.html.gz'
  '/index.htm.gz'
  '/index.html'
  '/index.htm'
]);
```

#### opts.maxAge
Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Enables the `Cache-Control` header on responses and sets the `max-age` value (in seconds).<br>
For example, `maxAge: 31536000` is equivalent to one year.

#### opts.immutable
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Appends the [`immutable` directive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#Revalidation_and_reloading) on your `Cache-Control` header, used for uniquely-named assets that will not change!

> **Important:** Will only work if `opts.maxAge` has a value defined!

#### opts.single
Type: `Boolean` or `String`<br>
Default: `false`

Treat the directory as a single-page application.

When `true`, the directory's index page (default `index.html`) will be sent if the request asset does not exist.<br>
You may pass a `string` value to use a file _instead of_ `index.html` as your fallback.

For example, if "/about" is requested but no variants of that file exist, then the response for "/" is sent instead:

```js
// Note: This is psuedo code to illustrate what's happening

// Request: "/about"
let file = find(['/about', '/about.html', '/about.htm', '/about/index.html', '/about.htm']);
if (file) {
  send(file);
} else if (opts.single === true) {
  file = find(['/', '/index.html', '/index.htm']);
  send(file);
} else if (typeof opts.single === 'string') {
  file = find([opts.single]);
  send(file);
} else {
  // next() or 404
}
```

#### opts.ignores
Type: `false` or `Array<String | RegExp>`

Specify paths/patterns that should ignore the fallback behavior that `opts.single` provides.

By default, any asset-like path (URLs that end with an extension) will be ignored. This means that, for example, if `/foobar.jpg` is not found, a `404` response is sent instead of the `index.html` fallback.

Additionally, any `/.well-known/*` pathname ignores the fallback – as do all other dotfile requests when `opts.dotfiles` is enabled.

Any string value(s) will be passed through `new RegExp(value, 'i')` directly.

Finally, you may set `ignores: false` to disable ***all*** ignores, including the defaults. Put differently, this will fallback ***all*** unknown pathnames to your `index.html` (or custom `opts.single` value).

> **Important:** Only has an effect if `opts.single` is enabled.

#### opts.onNoMatch
Type: `Function`

A custom function to run if a file cannot be found for a given request. <br>By default, `sirv` will send a basic `(404) Not found` response.

The function receives the current `req <IncomingMessage>, res <ServerResponse>` pair for as its two arguments.

> **Note:** This won't run if a `next` callback has been provided to the middleware; see [`sirv`](#sirvdir-opts) description.

#### opts.setHeaders
Type: `Function`

A custom function to append or change any headers on the outgoing response. There is no default.

Its signature is `(res, pathname, stats)`, where `res` is the `ServerResponse`, `pathname` is incoming request path (stripped of queries), and `stats` is the file's result from [`fs.statSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_statsync_path).

socks-proxy-agent 8.0.2
MIT
socks-proxy-agent
================
### A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a
specified SOCKS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http`
and `https` modules.

It can also be used in conjunction with the `ws` module to establish a WebSocket
connection over a SOCKS proxy. See the "Examples" section below.

Examples
--------

```ts
import https from 'https';
import { SocksProxyAgent } from 'socks-proxy-agent';

const agent = new SocksProxyAgent(
	'socks://your-name%40gmail.com:abcdef12345124@br41.nordvpn.com'
);

https.get('https://ipinfo.io', { agent }, (res) => {
	console.log(res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

```ts
import WebSocket from 'ws';
import { SocksProxyAgent } from 'socks-proxy-agent';

const agent = new SocksProxyAgent(
	'socks://your-name%40gmail.com:abcdef12345124@br41.nordvpn.com'
);

var socket = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.events', { agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
	console.log('"open" event!');
	socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
	console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
	socket.close();
});
```

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

stackback 0.0.2
MIT
# stackback

Returns an array of CallSite objects for a captured stacktrace. Useful if you want to access the frame for an error object.

## use

```javascript
var stackback = require('stackback');

// error generated from somewhere
var err = new Error('some sample error');

// stack is an array of CallSite objects
var stack = stackback(err);
```

## CallSite object

From the [V8 StackTrace API](https://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/JavaScriptStackTraceApi)

The structured stack trace is an Array of CallSite objects, each of which represents a stack frame. A CallSite object defines the following methods

getThis: returns the value of this  
getTypeName: returns the type of this as a string. This is the name of the function stored in the constructor field of this, if available, otherwise the object's [[Class]] internal property.  
getFunction: returns the current function  
getFunctionName: returns the name of the current function, typically its name property. If a name property is not available an attempt will be made to try to infer a name from the function's context.  
getMethodName: returns the name of the property of this or one of its prototypes that holds the current function  
getFileName: if this function was defined in a script returns the name of the script  
getLineNumber: if this function was defined in a script returns the current line number  
getColumnNumber: if this function was defined in a script returns the current column number  
getEvalOrigin: if this function was created using a call to eval returns a CallSite object representing the location where eval was called  
isToplevel: is this a toplevel invocation, that is, is this the global object?  
isEval: does this call take place in code defined by a call to eval?  
isNative: is this call in native V8 code?  
isConstructor: is this a constructor call?  

## install

```shell
npm install stackback
```

Many of the types here should have been built-in. You can help by suggesting some of them to the [TypeScript project](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Either add this package as a dependency or copy-paste the needed types. No credit required. 👌

PR welcome for additional commonly needed types and docs improvements. Read the [contributing guidelines](.github/contributing.md) first.

**Help wanted with reviewing [proposals](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pulls).**

### Type Guard

#### `IsType` vs. `IfType`

For every `IsT` type (e.g. `IsAny`), there is an associated `IfT` type that can help simplify conditional types. While the `IsT` types return a `boolean`, the `IfT` types act like an `If`/`Else` - they resolve to the given `TypeIfT` or `TypeIfNotT` depending on whether `IsX` is `true` or not. By default, `IfT` returns a `boolean`:

```ts
type IfAny<T, TypeIfAny = true, TypeIfNotAny = false> = (
	IsAny<T> extends true ? TypeIfAny : TypeIfNotAny
);
```

#### Usage

```ts
import type {IsAny, IfAny} from 'type-fest';

type ShouldBeTrue = IsAny<any> extends true ? true : false;
//=> true

type ShouldBeFalse = IfAny<'not any'>;
//=> false

type ShouldBeNever = IfAny<'not any', 'not never', 'never'>;
//=> 'never'

## Declined types

*If we decline a type addition, we will make sure to document the better solution here.*

- [`Diff` and `Spread`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/7) - The pull request author didn't provide any real-world use-cases and the PR went stale. If you think this type is useful, provide some real-world use-cases and we might reconsider.
- [`Dictionary`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/issues/33) - You only save a few characters (`Dictionary<number>` vs `Record<string, number>`) from [`Record`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeys-type), which is more flexible and well-known. Also, you shouldn't use an object as a dictionary. We have `Map` in JavaScript now.
- [`ExtractProperties` and `ExtractMethods`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/4) - The types violate the single responsibility principle. Instead, refine your types into more granular type hierarchies.
- [`Url2Json`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/262) - Inferring search parameters from a URL string is a cute idea, but not very useful in practice, since search parameters are usually dynamic and defined separately.
- [`Nullish`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/318) - The type only saves a couple of characters, not everyone knows what "nullish" means, and I'm also trying to [get away from `null`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/meta/discussions/7).
- [`TitleCase`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/303) - It's not solving a common need and is a better fit for a separate package.
- [`ExtendOr` and `ExtendAnd`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/247) - The benefits don't outweigh having to learn what they mean.
- [`PackageJsonExtras`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/issues/371) - There are too many possible configurations that can be put into `package.json`. If you would like to extend `PackageJson` to support an additional configuration in your project, please see the *Extending existing types* section below.

## Alternative type names

*If you know one of our types by a different name, add it here for discovery.*

- `PartialBy` - See [`SetOptional`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/blob/main/source/set-optional.d.ts)
- `RecordDeep`- See [`Schema`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/blob/main/source/schema.d.ts)
- `Mutable`- See [`Writable`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/blob/main/source/writable.d.ts)
- `Prettify`- See [`Simplify`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/blob/main/source/simplify.d.ts)

## Tips

### Extending existing types

- [`PackageJson`](source/package-json.d.ts) - There are a lot of tools that place extra configurations inside the `package.json` file. You can extend `PackageJson` to support these additional configurations.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# undici-types

This package is a dual-publish of the [undici](https://www.npmjs.com/package/undici) library types. The `undici` package **still contains types**. This package is for users who _only_ need undici types (such as for `@types/node`). It is published alongside every release of `undici`, so you can always use the same version.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

>       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
>       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
>       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
>       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

>       as of the date such litigation is filed.

>           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
>           the Derivative Works; and
>
>       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
>           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
>           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
>           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
>           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

>       the conditions stated in this License.
>
>    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

     * of the document.
