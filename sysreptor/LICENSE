# SysReptor Community License 1.1 (SysReptorL)
## Acceptance

In order to get any Permissions to Use the Software under the 
SysReptorL, you must agree to it as both strict obligations 
and conditions to all your Licenses.

## Copyright License

The licensor grants you a non-exclusive copyright Permission 
to Use the Software for everything you might do with the Software 
that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright in it for 
any permitted purpose, other than distributing the software or 
making changes or new works based on the Software. Attempts to 
circumvent technical License restrictions are prohibited (e.g. 
to unlock or extend functionalities), even if they result from 
errors in the Software.

## Patent License

The licensor grants you a non-exclusive patent License for the 
Software that covers patent claims the licensor can license, or 
becomes able to license, that you would infringe by using the 
Software after its Intended Use. 

## Internal Business Use

Use of the Software for the internal business operations of 
you and your Company is use for a permitted purpose.

## Personal Uses

Personal use for research, experiment, and testing for the 
benefit of public knowledge, personal study, private entertainment, 
hobby projects, amateur pursuits, or religious observance, 
without any anticipated commercial application, is use for a 
permitted purpose.

## Fair Use

You may have "**Fair Use**" rights for the Software under the law. 
The SysReptorL does not limit them unless otherwise agreed.

Pursuant to Section 40d of the Act on Copyright and Related 
Rights (Urheberrechtsgesetz, UrhG), computer programs may be 
edited and reproduced within the framework of the Fair Use of 
works to the extent that this is necessary for the Intended 
Use of the Software by the person entitled to use it. The 
**Intended Use** is limited to the permitted purpose of the Software 
in accordance with the SysReptorL.

## Plugin Development and Usage

The licensor grants you permission to develop and use plugins 
that use official plugin interfaces for the Software, provided 
that these plugins do not bypass any license restrictions. Use 
of non-official plugins that bypass or attempt to bypass license 
restrictions is a violation of these terms. This includes the 
usage of any plugins that unlock or extend functionalities in 
ways not permitted by the SysReptorL.

The licensor reserves the right to revoke or modify interfaces 
from and to the Software without prior notice. This may affect 
the functionality of plugins and other integrations.

## No Other Rights

The SysReptorL does not allow you to sublicense or transfer 
any of your Licenses to anyone else or prevent the licensor 
from granting Licenses to anyone else. The SysReptorL does not 
imply any other Licenses than those mentioned therein.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the Software infringes or 
contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent License 
for the Software granted under this SysReptorL ends immediately. If 
your Company makes such a claim, your patent License ends 
immediately for work on behalf of your Company. Irrespective of the 
withdrawal of Permission to Use the Software, we reserve the right 
to assert claims for damages.

## Violations

In case of license violations, all your licenses end immediately.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, the Software comes “as is”, without 
any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable 
to you for any damages arising out of this SysReptorL or the use 
or nature of the Software, under any kind of legal claim.***
